       "['The vast majority of laid-off or furloughed workers — 77 percent — expect to be rehired by their previous employer once the stay-at-home orders in their area are lifted, according to a nationwide Washington Post-Ipsos poll. Nearly 6 in 10 say it is “very likely” they will get their old job back, according to the poll, which was conducted April 27-May 4 among 928 workers who were laid off or furloughed since the outbreak began. But there’s concern that many of these workers are too optimistic about being rehired given how much uncertainty remains about health and business conditions in the year ahead.\\n\\nAnd the scope of the problem keeps mounting. The Labor Department on Thursday reported that 3.2 million Americans filed unemployment claims last week, bringing the seven-week total for people seeking jobless benefits to more than 33 million Americans. The unemployment rate has jumped from around 3.5 percent earlier this year to close to 20 percent now, many economists believe.\\n\\nThe United States is facing its biggest unemployment crisis since the Great Depression, as many firms have been quick to let employees go. Economists say the best chance for any sort of recovery is to get as many workers as possible back into their old jobs. Much of that will depend on how reopening goes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I figure they might call me at the end of this month to start again in June. But I don’t know,” said Mogna, 54, who sells materials to construction sites. “If I worked in a restaurant, I probably wouldn’t be that optimistic. But construction is still going.”\\n\\nGoing back to a prior job is typically much easier — and faster — than searching for an entirely new job. It also gives laid-off workers a greater sense of comfort about their finances. Studies show that workers who believe they are only a few weeks away from a steady job again are less likely to spiral into a depression or stop paying major bills.\\n\\nBut economists warn the optimism could be misplaced. The longer people are out of work, the less likely they are to be called back. In an alarming trend, companies such as General Electric and Nordstrom initially announced they were furloughing employees, a temporary layoff where workers aren’t paid but usually keep their health insurance. But now some of those furloughs are becoming permanent layoffs. MGM Resorts just warned it might make its furloughs permanent as well if businesses does not rebound this summer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA new report from the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago predicts 42 percent of the recent layoffs from the pandemic will result in permanent job losses. There are two big issues: First, many companies are going bankrupt or shutting down permanently, so they won’t need workers. Second, even after parts of the economy reopen, many people will be hesitant to shop, travel and go out to eat as they did before. Businesses operating at half capacity or switching to online or takeout don’t need nearly as many workers.\\n\\n“Even if a miracle cure falls out of the sky in July, it’s going to take demand a while to pick back up,” said Betsey Stevenson, an economics professor at the University of Michigan. “There’s no way travel or retail look the same and brings everybody back.”\\n\\nTypically, fewer than half of laid-off workers expect to return to their previous job, but there’s hope this time could be different, since many business shutdowns are likely to be temporary, said economist Till von Wachter of the University of California at Los Angeles.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Helping workers keep attached to their prior employers could speed up the recovery,” said von Wachter.\\n\\nEconomists have urged companies to furlough workers instead of laying them off, since a furlough allows for some sort of employer-employee relationship to remain even though a worker is no longer going to the job. Mogna has been able to keep his employer-sponsored health insurance. He has had to make his monthly payments, but it’s been a big help to know he has the same insurance during a global pandemic.\\n\\nLayoffs and furloughs skyrocketed in mid-March and have kept climbing as some businesses that initially tried to stay open found it was impossible. Americans still widely oppose reopening most businesses and remain hesitant to go to stores and restaurants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnease is rising among many of these jobless workers as they approach nearly two months out of a job. Roughly 1 in 4 laid-off workers say they will be in “real financial trouble” in less than a month if nothing changes. Among those laid off, 43 percent say the outbreak has been a “serious source of stress” in their life, compared with 29 percent among other Americans, the Post-Ipsos poll finds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChauncey Davis is worried about losing his place in Memphis. The 44-year-old father has struggled to pay his rent since he lost his job as a cook at Checkers in March as business slowed during the pandemic. He has been trying to input his information on the Internal Revenue Service website in the hope of getting a $1,200 relief payment to tide him over until he can find a new job, since he doesn’t think it’s likely he’ll be brought back.\\n\\n“Right now, I’m struggling just to pay for meals,” Davis said. “I’ve applied for unemployment twice but gotten no answer.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCongress has enacted $2.5 trillion in aid for struggling businesses and workers who have been hard hit by the mandates to stay at home to try to stop the spread of covid-19. Most of those laid off — 61 percent — say they have received a $1,200 or more relief check from the federal government to help offset expenses, but 38 percent have not.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s a similar story regarding unemployment insurance. Congress bumped up weekly unemployment checks by $600, meaning many workers are eligible for about $1,000 a week in unemployment compensation. But they have to be able to complete their application and receive the aid, a process that has been extremely slow in some states. In Florida, fewer than 30 percent of the 1.8 million people filing unemployment claims have been paid so far because of problems with the filing system. In other states, such as New York, many jobless workers had to call dozens of times a day for weeks to finalize their application.\\n\\nHalf of the laid-off workers say they have been able to apply for unemployment, but under 3 in 10 have received money so far, the Post-Ipsos poll finds. Of those who tried to apply but were unsuccessful, 4 in 10 report that they could not complete the application because phone lines were so busy that they could not get through or their state’s unemployment website wasn’t working.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe coming weeks are likely to be critical to see how many unemployed workers begin to transition back to work. The new Small Business Administration loans and grants — known as the Paycheck Protection Program — require firms to rehire employees by the end of June.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven if a large share of workers do get called back, millions of Americans are still likely to remain jobless. The nation’s unemployment rate is widely expected to hit 20 percent this spring and drop only to about 10 percent by the end of the year, meaning one in 10 workers would still be out of work at the holidays.\\n\\nScott Clement contributed to this report.\\n\\nPoll methodology: The Washington Post-Ipsos poll was conducted April 27-May 4 through Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. Results among the sample of 928 people who were laid off or furloughed during the coronavirus outbreak have a margin of sampling error of error margin of 3.5 percentage points.',\n",
       " \"I also teach twice-weekly online evening fitness classes, and I block my class times off on my work calendar. When a co-worker recently scheduled a two-hour meeting at 4:30 p.m. with one day's notice, I asked if I could present my topic early in the meeting so I could make my class. She refused, calling it a “conflict of interest.”\\n\\nIs there an acceptable way to refuse invites for these meetings outside normal business hours? Or is this the new Monday — Friday? And is teaching a fitness class after work really a “conflict of interest?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKarla: For anyone lucky enough to be working from home, the concept of “normal business hours” — more accurately, “pre-pandemic business hours” — has been upended. Before I get into how you deal with that, some reasons it’s happening:\\n\\nParents whose card-house schedules have been flattened and scattered to the winds are having to shuffle work hours with managing their kids’ education and care.\\n\\nEmployees living in isolation may be struggling to keep themselves on task without the guide rails of a busy workplace — or may be actively seeking more work to occupy themselves.\\n\\nPeople whose “golden hours” of productivity naturally skew earlier or later than the typical business day may find it less exhausting to stop fighting their internal clock.\\n\\nRegardless of family status, most of us are experiencing some mix of wakeful anxiety, crushing depression and numbing fear that demolishes the nine-to-five mind-set.\\n\\nWe’re not robots. We can’t perform as normal during not-normal times. But unlike robots, we can adapt, and working remotely gives us the flexibility to adapt so we can stay as balanced and productive as possible. The problem arises when one person’s option to be flexible begets an expectation that everyone else will bend in the same direction, at the same time, to the same degree.\\n\\nBosses are allowed those expectations. But good bosses try to base their expectations on broad principles and priorities, accommodate individuals’ challenges in meeting those expectations, and grant employees autonomy to set reasonable boundaries for themselves within those expectations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll of which is to say, start by checking whether your “normal business hours” need to be adjusted to fit mid-pandemic reality. Talk to your boss about establishing core hours of availability within flexible shifts (for example, core hours 10 to 2 daily, with early starts on specific days and late ends on others).\\n\\nOnce you have your boss’s support, and you have communicated your availability clearly via your online calendar/auto-reply/voice mail greeting, here are some tips on defending your schedule so you’re not having to cover every time zone.\\n\\nWhen someone schedules a meeting last-minute with seemingly no regard for the invitees’ availability, that creates a “conflict,” full stop — regardless whether you’re using that time to teach Zumba, talk to your therapist on Zoom or just zone out. And that’s all you need to say, although you can soften your RSVP by offering an alternative:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I’m sorry, I have a conflict that day. Can we try later in the week?”\\n\\n“I can attend the first part of the meeting, but I have a hard stop at 6.”\\n\\n“I’m not available Tuesdays after 5, but any other evening will work for me.”\",\n",

The companies generally reported uneven results, but they sent a consistent message: It is almost futile to predict performance in the coming months.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The still-scary levels of jobless claims combined with Apple and Amazon’s withdrawal are weighing on stocks,” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners. “There’s uncertainty on when and how the recovery takes place.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe bad news has piled up daily, led by more than 60,000 U.S. deaths ascribed to the coronavirus. U.S. gross domestic product contracted 4.8 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Thursday’s stock session ended in decline after new unemployment data showed U.S. job losses surged past 30 million since the pandemic hit domestically. A disappointing manufacturing report on Friday added to the growing pile of bad news.\\n\\nOil prices remain woefully depressed and far below the $50 range that most oil producers need to made a decent profit, despite a rebound in the past week. Crude prices have dropped more than 50 percent since January because of an oversupply brought on by a drop in demand due to global lockdowns.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world’s largest producers, also flooded the oil market, driving prices down further.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInvestors shrugged off the bad news for most of April, with Wall Street seizing on good news on the medical front against the coronavirus and a gradual reopening of the country.\\n\\nSmall medical advances sprinkled investors with hope the past two weeks as pharmaceutical companies worked on virus vaccines and treatments.

       " 'For comparison, 4.4 million people applied for benefits for the week ending April 18, and 30.3 million have sought benefits in the past six weeks alone. That figure represents roughly 1 in 5 American workers.\\n\\nThere is no precedent for figures like this in modern American history.\\n\\nAt first, national attention focused on the unprecedented wave of layoffs tied to restaurants and other nonessential businesses, said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and senior fellow of the Indeed Hiring Lab. But it quickly became clear that many more industries were going to be hit by the downturn. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, Sinclair pointed to recent job losses in the health-care industry, as surgeries and other elective procedures are canceled in large numbers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“No job is safe,” Sinclair said.\\n\\nDuring normal times, a few hundred thousand people might seek unemployment benefits on any given week, but millions of Americans have filed claims each week for more than a month. This has overwhelmed state processing centers and expedited the debate in Washington about how to respond to the economic turmoil. Many Americans have stopped paying their rent and other bills, and economists are predicting any recovery will stretch well into 2021, and possibly beyond.\\n\\nDuring normal times, the economy will add a few million jobs each year. It could take many years for the economy to add back the 30 million jobs lost in the past six weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe trouble is compounded by the fact that unemployment claims probably understate the jobs lost in the coronavirus recession. Overwhelmed state systems and burdensome application processes mean that millions who need benefits have not yet been able to access them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA recent analysis by Elise Gould and Ben Zipperer of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that, from March 15 to April 18, between 8.9 million and 13.9 million more people would have filed for unemployment benefits had the application process been easier.\\n\\nThe silver lining? A California Policy Lab analysis released Wednesday found that about 90 percent of people who claimed unemployment benefits in recent weeks expected to eventually be called back to work with their employers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSimilarly, Google search interest in the topic of furloughs has far exceeded layoff-related searches in recent weeks. The trend is the opposite of the Great Recession, when layoffs dominated and it took years to reestablish connections between workers and employers.\\n\\nThe California report also found enormous gaps in who had been forced to file for unemployment benefits. Since March 15, 37 percent of all workers with a high school degree or less filed for unemployment — compare that with just 6 percent of those who had a bachelor’s degree.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe next wave of layoffs could hit state and local government employees, potentially driving national unemployment figures past 40 million, said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. That pain could be especially acute in states like Florida and Texas, which have no personal income tax and rely heavily on sales taxes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If we’re thinking of it in medical terms, the patient needed a tourniquet, and we’ve stopped the bleeding on the leg, but now the arm might start bleeding,” Hunter said.\\n\\nThursday’s figures offer the latest snapshot at how badly — and quickly — the economy has suffered from the pandemic as people stay home and avoid travel, dining out, shopping and entertainment. Data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed the U.S. economy shrank 4.8 percent from January through March, marking the biggest decline since the Great Recession. As global air travel dries up, Boeing said Wednesday it plans a 10 percent staff reduction — more than 14,000 jobs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the same time, a growing number of states are pushing to reopen malls, factories, restaurants and other businesses, even amid worker and consumer concerns for public health.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Tuesday, President Trump signed an executive order giving the federal government broad powers to ensure that meat and poultry processing plants stay open. Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall owner, plans to reopen more than four dozen properties in 10 states. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) joined Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) in rolling back statewide restrictions.\\n\\nSinclair said it’s too soon to tell whether, or how soon, jobs will return to states vying to reopen. Data from the next few weeks could spell out whether businesses are rehiring — or if the virus and declining economy keep weekly unemployment claims in the millions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Do people feel safer going back to work? Are they getting jobs back with their old employers?” Sinclair asked. “That will help evaluate what the economy is going to look like the rest of the year.”',\n",
       " 'It’s not only curious — it’s disturbing. What it suggests is that American capitalism has entered a new and dangerous phase, one in which the Federal Reserve has assumed the role as a financial backstop and lender of last resort to every major corporation, along with the banks and investors that provide them with capital.\\n\\nBy declaring that it will do “whatever it takes” to assure that a corporate sector that borrowed too much can borrow a bit more, the Fed has effectively put a floor under stock and bond prices. As a result, it’s no longer just banks that are too big to fail — it’s now the entire corporate sector.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Fed would have us believe that it has offered no such guarantees and sent no such signal to investors. Rather, it is simply fulfilling its mandate to keep U.S. workers fully employed by providing “liquidity” to companies during a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic that nobody could have anticipated.\\n\\nBut that is only half the story. The other half is that because of loose money and the lax regulatory policies it has embraced for most of the past 30 years, the Fed has made it possible for corporations, banks and investment funds to take on so much debt, with so little of their own capital at risk, that whenever a recession or financial crisis threatens, the government has no choice but to bail them out.\\n\\nAs a result, Wall Street and the corporate sector have now achieved that state of financial nirvana in which private investors earn outsize rewards during good times, while in bad, outsize risks are socialized through government rescues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo someone from outside Wall Street — and even to a few inside — this looks less like capitalism than state control of the economy through the credit channel. What the Agriculture Department does for farmers through crop supports, the Fed now does for Wall Street and the rest of the corporate sector.\\n\\nFed officials have learned to play a cute messaging game around this creep toward corporate and investor socialism, denying it in public speeches and news conferences even as their actions send the unmistakable signal to Wall Street that “we’ve got your back.”\\n\\nWhere all this now plays out is in several obscure “loan facilities” and “special purpose vehicles” that the Fed set up last month — initiatives that for the first time will put the Fed in the business of buying the debt of private companies. Since its founding, the Fed has routinely carried out its mandate to manage the country’s money supply by buying and selling U.S. government bonds or government-guaranteed securities, and increasing or decreasing the amount of reserves in government-regulated banks. Now, however, the Fed has committed more than $2 trillion to buying (or taking as loan collateral) corporate bonds, shorter-term commercial paper, shares of corporate bond funds and ETFs and securitized packages of commercial loans. In effect, the Fed has turned itself into the world’s largest hedge fund — only unlike a hedge fund, it won’t have to raise its money from investors. Instead it simply prints it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn announcing this extraordinary expansion of its risk-taking and market intervention, the Fed took pains to assure that it would only be dealing in loans and credit instruments from companies that had investment-grade credit ratings before the pandemic — solidly profitable businesses with modest debt that because of factors outside their control now find themselves in a cash squeeze. As they see it, providing such companies a bridge loan is not a reward for risky behavior but the only way to prevent a short economic downturn from turning into a long and deep recession.\\n\\nBut stock and bond investors are clearly expecting the Fed to do more than that. They know that more than half of the corporate lending during the recent credit bubble was not investment grade. They understand that if those companies default or are unable to roll over their debt, there will be a cascade of layoffs, bankruptcies and panic-selling. And they are now confident that, to avoid that outcome, the Fed will have no choice but to do for “junk” credit what it has already done for investment-grade loans — buy enough of it to stabilize markets and give investors and lenders the confidence to extend new loans.\\n\\nThe dilemma the Fed now faces is that the only way it has to rescue the economy is to lend more money to businesses, households, governments and financial institutions that have already borrowed too much. That debt has made the economy vulnerable to any economic shock that has come along, requiring at least four extraordinary government rescues since 1987. And with each rescue, the economy becomes more indebted, more vulnerable, more addicted to cheap and easy money and more reliant on government rescues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCrises like these are both the worst of times and the best of times to try to break this economic doom loop and bring to heel a shadow banking system that is responsible for creating all that credit.\\n\\nIt is the worst of times because refusing to pile more debt on debt will bring the economy crashing down on innocent people of modest means who will sacrifice jobs, income, savings and opportunity.\\n\\nIt is the best of times because these are the times when the folly and unsustainability of our credit addiction is exposed and there is the political will to fix it.\\n\\nWhat would “fixing it” mean?\\n\\nIn the short term, fixing it would mean making any Fed rescue of “junk” credit contingent on having investors and financiers accepting significant losses while allowing the government to reap the benefit if things turn out better than expected. Creating the mechanism for such a workout will be a challenge, but surely the overpaid lawyers and investment bankers who created the shadow banking system are clever enough to figure it out.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFixing it would impose a regulatory regime on the shadow banking system similar to the one that limits the risk-taking of traditional banks. That would mean having government bank examiners scrutinize securitized loan packages to ensure that the loans met the same standards as those of regulated banks. It would mean requiring sponsors of loan packages to absorb the first 10 percent of losses on the securities they create. And it would mean imposing a tax on every financial transaction to create a stabilization fund that can be used to reimburse the Fed and the Treasury for the cost of financial-sector rescues — the equivalent of the deposit insurance premiums paid by regulated banks.\\n\\nFixing it would mandate that the Fed “unprint” all the money it creates during rescues once the crisis has passed, even if that makes boom times less boomy, with tighter credit and less job growth.\\n\\nAnd fixing it means moving corporations away from a private-equity model that requires them to load up with debt, expand through acquisition and distribute all profits to investors, to a stewardship model that focuses on creating sustainable businesses through organic growth, modest leverage and reinvestment of profits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'Companies should soon be able to go to their banks to obtain one of these loans, but the program is not up and running yet. Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said Wednesday he expected the “Main Street Lending Program” to be operational “fairly quickly.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“These are not grants. These are loans,” Powell emphasized Wednesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMost small businesses with less than 500 employees have been encouraged to seek a Small Business Administration loan, known as the Paycheck Protection Program, because that can be forgiven if a small businesses uses most of the money to rehire and pay employees.\\n\\nThe Fed’s program is designed to target midsize companies and businesses that need money for more than just payroll expenses. The minimum loan size is $500,000, and companies will have up to four years to pay the money back. Most of the loans are capped at $25 million, but the Fed created an additional option to obtain a loan of up to $200 million.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe interest rate on the loans will be about 3.4 percent, as it is set three percentage points above the LIBOR, a global benchmark interest rate. By contrast, the Small Business Administration’s PPP loans were set at a much lower interest rate of 1 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe loans will be available to a broad range of businesses, though there is not currently an option for nonprofits to apply for the Main Street loans. The Fed said it is looking into what it can do for these organizations.\\n\\nLawmakers, especially from states with struggling oil and energy companies, have urged the Fed to expand the Main Street program to include larger firms and businesses that already have a lot of debt. On Thursday, the Fed announced that companies can apply for a special “expanded loan” of up to six times the company’s worth. But there’s a catch: The bank approving the loan has to hold on to at least 15 percent of it, a higher threshold that puts more onus on banks to evaluate if a customer should get the riskier loan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Fed stressed Thursday that it is making these loans to “small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the pandemic.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut some argue the Fed is now extending a lifeline to oil and gas companies that borrowed too much money long before the pandemic hit and did not have a sustainable business model.\\n\\n“The Fed has at least partially buckled to administration & congressional pressure to make main st. lending program available to some fossil fuel companies,” tweeted Graham Steele, director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Taxpayer money will be propping up polluters & paying off investors who have bankrolled climate change.”',\n",
       " '“If anybody’s entitled to it, they are,” Trump told Fox News on March 30 when asked about proposals to give “hazard pay” to front-line medical personnel. “These are really brave people. Actually, they are warriors, in a sense.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut a proposal to offer such aid has not been seriously considered during negotiations over any of the four bills approved by Congress to respond to the novel coronavirus, according to a half-dozen congressional aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, including the $484 billion bill passed last week.\\n\\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said negotiations with Congress continue. A White House statement noted that billions of dollars have been approved for hospitals, which could help pay worker bonuses, among a variety of other expenses. There’s no evidence yet hospitals are doing that. The White House did not respond when asked whether Trump has taken any action to pursue hazard pay specifically for medical workers.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has released a proposal for a “Heroes Fund” that would give up to $25,000 per person for a broad category of front-line workers including doctors and nurses — as well as other essential personnel such as grocery workers and delivery drivers. The White House declined to comment on Schumer’s proposal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“President Trump is already working with Congress to ensure these brave men and women are properly compensated for their incredible work,” Deere said in a statement.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also said he hopes to see hazard pay included the next aid package. Congressional aides caution it could be weeks before such a measure is approved.\\n\\nMore than 45 nurses in the United States have died of covid-19, the disease the novel coronavirus causes, while at least a half-dozen doctors have died in states including Arizona, Michigan, Florida and New York.\\n\\nInstead of hiking salaries for medical workers, numerous hospitals across the country have slashed pay for nurses and doctors, as the suspension of elective surgeries drains health-care companies of a vital source of revenue. Health-care systems in California, Maine, Minnesota and Colorado have all announced pay cuts or furloughs to their employees. Stanford Health Care announced pay cuts this week of up to 20 percent for roughly 14,000 health-care workers, including personnel responding to the coronavirus.\\n\\nConcerns about compensation for medical workers go beyond additional hazard pay. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act that Congress passed in March specifically excludes health-care companies and firms with more than 500 employees from having to give two weeks of paid sick leave.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNursing homes have been a telling example of a critical part of the health system where workers are getting little to no extra pay during the crisis and often lack paid sick leave. One in six nursing homes have reported coronavirus cases so far.\\n\\nWorkers at several nursing homes told The Washington Post that they have to use their “PTO” — paid time off for both illness and vacation — if they get sick. Often, they have only a few days of PTO, which is far less than the two weeks typically recommended for quarantining. Nursing homes employ 1.6 million people, and the median pay is $15 an hour, according to the Labor Department.\\n\\nIn total, up to 13 million health workers and other emergency responders, including some nurses and hospital cleaning employees, won’t get two weeks of emergency sick pay because of the way Congress wrote the law, according to Labor Department estimates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFront-line workers say extra hazard wages or sick pay could make a big difference for them. Delma Garza, a nurse at a long-term-care facility in Texas, said she was instructed to stay home for the first two weeks of April because she had been exposed to another worker who tested positive for the coronavirus at the facility. But Garza said she was not paid during her quarantine.\\n\\n“That makes it hard,” said Garza, 42. “The bills are still piling up. If I don’t pay rent, I’m afraid we’ll get evicted. It’s $960 for rent.”\\n\\nGarza also helps transport patients from hospitals to the care facility, another risky job right now. She returned to work after not showing any symptoms during quarantine, but she is so worried about being a carrier of the virus that she sent her grandchild to live with someone else.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDavid Saucedo, 52, a cook at Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center and Hospital in Baltimore, prepares breakfast, lunch and dinner for patients despite fearing he will bring the virus from a patient to his partner, who has asthma. Saucedo received hazard pay while deployed during the first Gulf War and says the conditions he is working in now are no less dangerous.\\n\\n“During the war, we would get paid extra money — hazard and duty pay — when we were put in danger,” he said. “People like me are spending a lot of their own money just cleaning our uniforms every day to not get people sick.\"\\n\\nDespite Trump’s apparent support, congressional Republicans could prove an obstacle to increasing emergency pay for front-line workers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe issue has not been at the forefront of discussions among Republican lawmakers, according to interviews with four GOP congressional aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. GOP officials view Schumer’s proposal as overly broad and are likely to voice concerns about its price tag, the aides said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Politically, it’s hard to oppose, but there will be concerns: ‘How big is it? What is the universe of workers?’ And some doctors and nurses are already well-paid,” said one senior Republican aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe likely caucus thinking on the matter.\\n\\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to comment on whether he supports Schumer’s proposal or efforts to provide hazard pay to front-line workers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring negotiations in March, Senate Republicans objected to a plan by Democrats to require Trump to increase by 25 percent the pay for federal front-line workers, such as FEMA and Army Corps of Engineers personnel, according to two people familiar with the matter. A Republican Senate aide disputed that account, saying the measure was not proposed until after passage of the $2 trillion Cares Act.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chair of the government affairs committee, does not support giving special benefits to federal employees, according to a spokesman, who also denied that Johnson blocked the measure in negotiations.\\n\\nThe lack of emergency pay is one of several ways in which front-line workers beyond the medical profession say recent moves to help the country have left them out.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are about 50 million “essential” employees still going to their workplaces daily and facing exposure to the coronavirus, according to the Brookings Institution. Many earn less than $18 an hour despite putting themselves and their families at risk. Some companies like Costco, Target, Amazon and Safeway are paying an extra $2 an hour in “appreciation pay” during the pandemic, but policies vary widely.\\n\\nAt least 17 meatpacking workers and dozens of grocery store employees and delivery drivers across the nation have died of the coronavirus, according to data from unions and news reports.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It is an outrage we are asking millions of workers to continue to show up to their jobs for the rest of us at a risk to their own lives, while paying them wages too low to even sustain a family,” said Molly Kinder, a fellow at Brookings. “It’s been weeks of praise and platitudes from leaders out of Washington about these ‘heroes on the front lines,’ but they have done absolutely nothing to provide them with adequate compensation.”\\n\\nWhen Congress mandated that most companies provide at least two weeks of paid sick leave for employees who are exposed to the coronavirus or are advised to stay home by a medical professional, the final bill excluded people working for a “health-care provider” or “emergency responder.” The Labor Department got to define what constitutes a “health-care provider,” and the definition is so broad it can include janitors working at a hospital for third-party companies, said Tanya L. Goldman, an attorney at the Center for Law and Social Policy. The New York attorney general filed a lawsuit against the Labor Department to try to scale back the definition.\\n\\nAbout 2 million grocery store workers, half a million pharmacy workers and nearly a million truckers and transport drivers also don’t have access to paid sick leave, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis of government data. Because these workers are at companies with over 500 employees, they are not eligible for emergency paid leave under the new law.\\n\\nA Gallup survey of U.S. workers in March found that 40 percent of transportation employees and nearly a third of health-care personnel said they do not get any paid sick leave. On a call with reporters Thursday, Labor Department officials said they had rapidly implemented the new benefit for millions of workers after closely consulting with “stakeholders” across the country.\\n\\nMany grocery stores like Safeway say they will pay if their workers get sick, but employees must have a confirmed test, which has been hard to obtain in many parts of the country for all but the worst cases. Only 8 percent of workers in grocery, retail and food service jobs have access to two weeks of paid sick time, according to a study of 30,000 workers by the Shift Project.\\n\\nStill, Trump has continued to celebrate the work of doctors and nurses in his coronavirus briefings.\\n\\n“Through it all, we have seen the heroism of our doctors and nurses like never before. These are our warriors. The bravery of our truck drivers, such bravery, and food suppliers,” Trump said at a White House news conference last week. “Such incredible bravery.”',\n",
       " '“We are going to see economic data for the second quarter that’s worse than any data we’ve seen for the economy,” Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said in a video news conference. He called it “heartbreaking” to witness millions of job losses, especially in minority communities.\\n\\nThere is widespread agreement that the U.S. economy is in the midst of its worst crisis since the Great Depression, and Commerce Department data released Wednesday revealed just how severe it is becoming. Consumer and business spending nosedived in the first quarter, even with the economy shuttered for only half of March. Household spending tumbled 7.6 percent, and business investment sank 8.6 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough Americans flooded grocery stores to buy food and supplies, it was not nearly enough to offset lost spending on dining out, car sales, entertainment and other purchases.\\n\\nPowell vowed repeatedly Wednesday to use all of the Fed’s tools to keep U.S. businesses and households afloat during the crisis, but he warned that a recovery could take a while and that there is a significant risk of long-term damage if Congress and the central bank do not do enough to aid the economy.\\n\\n“It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,” Powell said, adding, “It is important that we do everything we can to avoid that longer-run damage.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarkets largely ignored the dour first-quarter economic data Wednesday, rallying on small but significant scientific advances against covid-19. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 532.31 points, or 2.2 percent. Markets are up nearly 14 percent in April and on track to post the best month since October 1974.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMore than 26 million Americans have already lost their jobs and had to seek unemployment aid, and those numbers are expected to rise Thursday with a new round of jobless claims. Many businesses are on the verge of going bankrupt, since they do not have enough money to sustain weeks without any customers or revenue.\\n\\nIt took three years to really begin to climb out of the Great Recession and more than a decade to recover from the Great Depression of the 1930s. Analysts say the government was too slow to act and too stingy with aid in the past, mistakes that should not be repeated now.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is a “Depression-like shock,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at audit firm RSM. “Policymakers should be prepared to support other rounds of aid and stimulus for an economy that is going to be reeling for some time.”\\n\\nPowell echoed that sentiment in his Wednesday news conference. “This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States,” Powell said, adding that “this is not the time” to be concerned about the national debt.\\n\\nAnalysts say the second quarter is likely to show a decline of more than 30 percent — a level not seen since the Great Depression — as much of the economy shut down to try to encourage people to stay home to stop the spread of the virus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There’s really no question about it. We are in a recession, and it’s going to be a sharp recession,” said economist Alicia Modestino, associate director of the Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy.\\n\\nAn official recession occurs when the economy experiences two consecutive quarters of negative growth. A depression is a sustained period of contraction and job loss that lasts for several years. President Trump and many on Wall Street hope the government’s historic levels of aid can avert a depression.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump predicted a quick recovery while talking with business leaders from companies including Toyota, Wynn Resorts and Waffle House about reopening the economy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I really think next year is going to be a tremendous year, and I think the fourth quarter is going to be fantastic,” Trump said. “I can feel it. I can feel the demand.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet economists across the political spectrum are more skeptical and are urging the federal government to give more money to states, cities and counties to avert mass layoffs and keep critical services going. They also foresee a need for more testing and more help for people out of work.\\n\\n“We know Main Street recovers less quickly than Wall Street,” Modestino said. “It will take years to get back to where we were before with such low unemployment.”\\n\\nSo far, the Fed has pumped $2.3 trillion into the economy in the past six weeks, and analysts expect the Fed to bump that up to at least $5 trillion in aid by the end of the year. The amount is unprecedented and dwarfs the relief that Congress and the White House have provided.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Fed’s swift interventions are widely credited with prompting a stock market rally in April and returning many parts of the bond market to normal after they froze up in March.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Powell’s mantra is do whatever it takes for as long as it takes,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. “There was a late reaction from Congress and the administration to the unfolding crisis. Powell sized up very quickly that the Fed needed to provide support.”\\n\\nThe Fed is expected to keep interest rates at zero for years, making it cheap to borrow money to buy a home or car or to start a company.\\n\\n“We’re going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off,” Powell said Wednesday. “We’re going to wait until we’re quite confident that the economy is well on the road to recovery.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile the U.S. economy started off the year on solid footing, the situation deteriorated rapidly in March with the spread of the coronavirus, as Trump declared a national emergency and said gatherings should be limited to no more than 10 people. National and state-level decisions aimed at protecting the people’s health prompted millions of restaurants, gyms, stores, coffee shops and other businesses to shutter.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnnie Clark has owned Get Noticed Boutique in Richardson, Tex., for 15 years and has never seen anything like this. Most of her sales are done in the store. Shutting that down was a huge blow.\\n\\n“I’ve been through a lot of ups and downs, but this is definitely uncharted territory,” Clark said. “What do you do? You sit on inventory and sit on big bills. … I can only just pray and hope the community I live in is going to support me when we reopen.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClark has had to borrow money on credit cards and from family to stay afloat, since getting a loan from a bank or the Small Business Administration has been difficult. But like many small-business owners, she will be able to survive only for so long.\\n\\n“I hope I don’t have to close,” she said. “I’ve gotten little sleep with the unknown.”\\n\\nOne of the biggest concerns for business owners is whether customers will come back quickly once governors and mayors say it is all right to reopen or whether shoppers will be fearful to venture out. Early evidence from China and states such as Georgia that are trying to reopen is that caution abounds and spending remains way down.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If consumers and workers remain housebound into the third quarter, or if the pandemic fades and then reemerges, the recession could last throughout 2020,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. “The longer consumers are stuck at home and workers can’t get to their jobs, the greater the structural damage to the U.S. economy.”\\n\\nTo support the economy, the Fed has mainly purchased U.S. government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, much as it did during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. But given that the pandemic has caused most of the economy to shut down for an extended period of time, there has been a massive rush to borrow money as businesses and households struggle.\\n\\nGiven what’s happening, the Fed has pledged to buy corporate, state and local debt and make loans to midsize companies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany on Wall Street and in the business community are eager to know when the Fed will begin its Main Street Lending Program that is supposed to make loans to companies with about 500 to 10,000 employees. Powell said that the corporate debt program would start “fairly soon” but that the Main Street program would take longer to get going.\\n\\nNobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer is urging the U.S. government to spend $100 billion to test nearly everyone in the nation to put people at ease that the virus is under control and that it is truly safe to reemerge. But so far, only about 2 percent of the nation has been tested.',\n",
       " 'Under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was enacted in the Cares Act and given additional funding last week, those business loans can be forgiven entirely if companies do not lay off employees or if they rehire or replace employees that they have already laid off. At least 75 percent of the loan has to be spent on payroll for the loan to be forgiven.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere are some common concerns as Americans head back to work.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPlease note none of this is legal advice, and your outcome may vary depending on your situation. You may need to consult legal counsel.\\n\\nQ: Do I have to return to work if I am pregnant or have a health condition that places me at higher risk if I am exposed to the coronavirus?\\n\\nTry to obtain documentation from a health-care provider that you are especially vulnerable and at high risk, and that your health-care provider recommends self-quarantine. Once you have done that, your options include:\\n\\n— asking your employer to grant you reasonable accommodations (such as alternative duties or temporary job-protected leave, for example) under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n— asking to be granted paid sick or emergency Family and Medical Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\\n\\nQ: Can my employer make me return to work if I don’t have child care?\\n\\nUnder the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, employers have to provide employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they can’t work because they have symptoms of covid-19, are quarantined or have to care for a child when schools and day-care centers are closed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFamilies First requires employers of 500 or fewer to provide partially paid emergency Family and Medical Leave to employees who have children at home needing care.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis option is available only to workers who cannot perform any part of their job at home.\\n\\nIf Families First leave is not available — for example, if your employer is so small the Labor Department exempts it — you can try requesting job-protected unpaid leave.\\n\\nQ: I am not convinced my workplace is safe, and I don’t want to risk exposing myself or people at home. What are my options?\\n\\nIf you don’t fall under the Americans With Disabilities Act of Families First options above, your only other option may be to hope to be laid off or furloughed without pay so you can collect unemployment. But an employer who has obtained a PPP loan may not want to take this route.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf you’re employed and furloughed, your employer will need to pay you with PPP funds to have its loan forgiven. If you have been laid off, your employer will have to replace you with another hire to keep its head count consistent so it can have the loan forgiven.\\n\\nIf you believe your employer is operating unsafely (refusing to adopt preventive measures or provide sanitizer or PPE, for example), you can file a complaint with your state’s labor agency or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but don’t expect a swift resolution.\\n\\nQ: Do I have to return to work if our state is under stay-at-home orders and our business is nonessential?\\n\\nYour state will have its own rules on how nonessential businesses can operate during the pandemic. These may include limiting the number of workers allowed in the workplace, shuttering its doors to the public or providing workers with protective equipment. If you think your employer is violating the state’s mandates, you can file a complaint with the appropriate state agency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nQ: How can I find out if my employer has applied for or received a PPP loan?\\n\\nIn most cases, employers will notify their workers if they receive PPP funds because they will need to call them back to work so they can have the loan forgiven. Also, the employer will probably want to adjust its filings with the state’s unemployment office if it starts paying wages to any of its furloughed employees so those workers don’t receive additional unemployment benefits they’re not entitled to.\\n\\nPublicly traded companies that apply for PPP loans have to file a Form 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That information is searchable on the SEC website.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn rare cases, employees can demand information from their employers under disclosure laws. This is a contentious option and should be considered only as a last resort; consult a lawyer before taking this step.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nQ: Do I have to return to work if I am receiving more in unemployment benefits than I would be receiving in wages?\\n\\nIf you qualify for state unemployment benefits because of covid-19, you probably also qualify for an additional $600 per week under the Cares Act. If that’s more money than you receive in regular wages, staying on unemployment may seem like a no-brainer. However, there are risks:\\n\\nIf you are invited back to work and turn it down, you may no longer qualify for unemployment benefits under your state’s rules.\\n\\nIf your employer decides to lay you off and hire someone else with its PPP funds, you may no longer qualify for unemployment benefits.\\n\\nEven if you stay on unemployment, and your employer simply hires someone else without challenging your rights to unemployment benefits, the Cares Act’s $600-per-week benefits boost will end by July 31, 2020.\\n\\nAfter that, if you can’t get by on state unemployment benefits, you’ll need to find another job — and so will millions of other people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nQ: My employer got a PPP loan and is asking us to do work other than what we usually do — cleaning the office for example — until the business reopens. Do I have to do this?\\n\\nEmployers don’t have to require employees to do work when it’s paying them with PPP funds — but as discussed last week, if there’s work to be done, the employer can require it, even if it’s not the same work you usually perform. If the work exposes you to health risks, you may be able to seek a reasonable accommodation under Americans with Disabilities or file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But if you refuse to do the work, your employer may be able to fire you for cause, which could jeopardize your eligibility for unemployment benefits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nQ: My employer is giving hourly workers only six hours a day. Can they do this?\\n\\nUnder the Cares Act, employers have to spend at least 75 percent of the PPP loan on payroll costs to have the loan forgiven. Employees must receive 75 percent of the average weekly pay they received for the first quarter of 2020. If they’re working six hours instead of eight, that’s 75 percent, which is enough for the employer’s PPP loan to be forgiven.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the pay you’re receiving is less than 75 percent, you may qualify for partial benefits with your state’s unemployment agency.\\n\\nQ: Do employers have to rehire the same people to have the PPP loan forgiven, or can they hire someone new?\\n\\nThe goal of the PPP is to allow employers to retain their workforce and minimize the costs of hiring and training new talent, while reducing the burden on state unemployment systems. But companies do not have to hire back the same workers as long as their overall employment numbers remain the same.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nQ: My employer has two businesses but got a PPP loan for just one of them, which is not the one I work for, so I am working unpaid. Can my boss do this?\\n\\nEmployers applying for PPP loans must disclose any affiliated companies. It all depends on the details of how your employer’s businesses are structured, but generally, if the employer applied for a PPP loan for one business, using information from the other, the PPP loan funds should be used to pay employees of both companies.\\n\\nRegardless, if you are doing any work unpaid, that is wage theft. You should report it to your state’s labor agency and the federal Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division.\\n\\nQ: Where can I complain if I believe my employer is abusing its PPP loan?\\n\\nYou can report suspected PPP fraud anonymously to the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General at 1-800-767-0385 or at sba.gov. Just know that, as with most employment-related public agencies right now, the SBA is slammed and underfunded, so any complaints may take a long time to be resolved.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany thanks to Amy Epstein Gluck and Lenore Horton, partners at FisherBroyles LLP; Declan Leonard, business law partner at Berenzweig Leonard; and Tom Spiggle, principal at Spiggle Law.\\n\\nHelpful resources:',\n",
       " 'Many economists — and even President Trump — have praised the Fed’s swift action to help the nation survive financially during a historic lockdown to fight the novel coronavirus. But some critics warn the Fed is overstepping its role and might never be able to withdrawal these high levels of government support for the U.S. economy.\\n\\nFed Chair Jerome H. Powell has made it clear he will do whatever it takes to prevent another Great Depression. His preference has been to act early and boldly to prevent the worst-case scenario from happening during Trump’s trade war and now during the pandemic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Fed leaders will conclude a two-day meeting by releasing a statement at 2 p.m., followed by Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. Wall Street investors and many business owners are anxiously awaiting word from Powell on how quickly he thinks the economy can rebound and how much more money the Fed is planning to deploy in such a dramatic fashion.\\n\\n“Powell’s mantra is do whatever it takes for as long as it takes,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. “There was a late reaction from Congress and the administration to the unfolding crisis. Powell sized up very quickly that the Fed needed to provide support.”\\n\\nThe Fed cut interest rates to zero on March 15 and unleashed a bond-buying frenzy to prevent markets from freezing up just as companies and households were trying to get loans to survive financially. The result of all of this bond buying is that the Fed’s assets have ballooned to a record level of $6.6 trillion, up from $4.3 trillion in March.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnalysts say the Fed is not done yet. The central bank is widely expected to hold close to $10 trillion soon, as it expands existing programs and starts others.\\n\\n“Don’t rule out the possibility that the Fed is not done. It could increase the size of programs that have been successful so far or start something else completely new,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “I was at the Fed in 2008. We were throwing a lot against the wall to see what stuck.”\\n\\nSo far, most of the $2.3 trillion the Fed has injected into the economy has come from buying U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, similar to the central bank’s playbook during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Many say the Fed’s actions have helped trigger a rally in stocks in April and an unfreezing of many parts of the bond market.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the Fed is about to embark on something it has never done before: Directly buying corporate bonds, directly buying debt from cities and states, and making “Main Street” loans to midsize firms. These are far more complex and politically sensitive moves than buying U.S. Treasury bonds, but Fed leaders argue they are necessary to keep plenty of credit flowing at a time when so many businesses, households and local governments desperately need loans.\\n\\nInvestors and businesses await more details on when the Fed will role out these programs and how widely they will buy. Oil companies and retailers are especially hoping the central bank will buy their debt, a lifeline that could help some firms avoid bankruptcy. The Fed, however, has delicate choices to make because it is not supposed to bail out specific companies, especially ones that took on too much risk.\\n\\nTrump and at least one former Fed official have also called for negative interest rates in the United States, something Powell has been hesitant to endorse because it has not been easy to reverse that policy in Europe and Japan. It also does not seem warranted when loans are already cheap.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Slightly cheaper credit doesn’t make any difference if stores are closed,” said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\\n\\nAnother fear is that the Fed could trigger an ugly spell of high inflation like what the United States experienced in the 1970s after the central bank arguably kept interest rates too low.\\n\\n“It does beg the question of how far Washington can go in issuing and monetizing debt before everyone pays a price in terms of higher interest rates, higher taxes and higher inflation,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.\\n\\nFor now, the Fed’s statement and Powell’s news conference Wednesday are likely to commit to seeing the economy through this crisis but remain a little vague on the details to maintain flexibility. So much uncertainty remains about when parts of the economy can reopen safely and when a coronavirus vaccine will be widely available.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'In the absence of a federal mandate, states are adopting varying approaches to the speed and pace of their commercial revivals. During a White House meeting with Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said he would make an announcement Wednesday on his state’s reopening plans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBusinesses in Georgia — including massage centers and barbershops — began welcoming customers Friday for the first time since Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued a mandatory shelter-in-place order on April 2. And in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is allowing certain businesses, including retailers, restaurants and movie theaters, to reopen at the end of the week, but at only 25 percent capacity.\\n\\nAfter several weeks of a comprehensive economic pause, companies, workers and consumers are returning to a changed landscape. The steady growth and low unemployment that Americans enjoyed just two months ago have vanished. Hanging over plans to restart the nation’s economic engine are unprecedented health concerns, as individuals balance each shopping trip, airplane flight and restaurant meal against the risk of catching a sometimes-fatal illness.\\n\\n“Consumers may have permission to go do something. But whether they go do it depends upon how badly they want to do it and how safe they feel,” said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the White House, Trump sought to look beyond the deepening recession that economists say is pushing unemployment higher than at any time since the Great Depression. He said July, August and September would bring a “transition” to a stronger rebound in the weeks before and after the November election.\\n\\n“I think [the] fourth quarter\\'s going to be incredibly strong. I think next year is going to be an unbelievably strong year,” the president told reporters.\\n\\nHis upbeat remarks came just hours before the Commerce Department was expected to report Wednesday that the economy contracted at its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008, when the global financial crisis was gathering steam.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It is going to be the worst we’ve seen, probably,” said Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, calling the situation “temporary.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSustained improvement now depends upon wooing workers and consumers to return to factories, restaurants and shops. There already are signs that it may not be easy.\\n\\nAfter 20 meatpacking plants closed in recent weeks following covid-19 outbreaks, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union complained about unsafe working conditions. A worker at a Smithfield Foods plant in Missouri sued the company in federal court, saying it had failed to take action to protect its employees, including altering operations to permit social distancing, providing protective gear and encouraging sick employees to stay home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe New Braunfels, Tex., restaurant where Olivia Wise, 22, works as a waitress is planning to reopen Friday, when the state begins allowing some businesses to operate at 25 percent capacity. But the young woman, who lives with her parents, doesn’t feel comfortable going back just yet.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I personally think it’s still too soon,” she said. “It’s awesome they want to get the economy going again, but it’s not worth risking getting my parents sick.”\\n\\nConsumers, too, do not appear to be in any rush to leave home. While there have been scattered protests of lockdown orders in a handful of states, the current limits on activity draw solid public support. In a new Washington Post poll, 66 percent of respondents — including 62 percent of Republicans — agreed that existing limits on restaurants, stores and businesses were “appropriate,” while just 17 percent said they were too restrictive.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA key test of consumer willingness to brave health fears will come as soon as Friday, when Simon Property Group, the nation’s largest mall owner, plans to reopen more than four dozen properties in 10 states, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn another sign of returning normalcy, Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson told investors Tuesday that he expects to have about 90 percent of all company-owned stores open by early June.\\n\\nThe administration’s hopes for a swift V-shaped recovery are clouded by the danger that a premature reopening might result in a new surge of infections, which would require some states to order a second shutdown. Besides testing public compliance, such an order could interrupt supply chains.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This is what matters. The risk is you’ve got to shut down again,” said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard.\\n\\nWashington is fighting the pandemic on all fronts. The Federal Reserve and Congress are devoting a combined $9 trillion in aid to saving the wounded economy, according to Kudlow.\\n\\nProgress so far has been easier to detect in financial markets, which have rebounded from their late-March lows and sometimes disorderly trading, than in the lives of average Americans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA closely watched index of consumer sentiment from the Conference Board fell sharply Tuesday to 86.9 in April from 118.8 in March. A separate measure of current conditions posted its sharpest fall ever, reflecting the massive rise in unemployment amid the pandemic-related shutdown, the group said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nExpectations for the next six months rose slightly, as consumers foresaw an end to mandatory business closures.\\n\\nMillions of Americans have lost their jobs in recent weeks, forcing many families to rethink their spending habits. In Texas, Wise and her parents, who are also out of work, have spent the past six weeks whittling down their expenses by downgrading their cable plan, forgoing restaurant meals, and doing without new clothes and shoes.\\n\\n“All of a sudden it was like, ‘Oh crap, what do we do? Nobody in this house has a job,’” said Wise.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTwo weeks after she was laid off from her waitress job in mid-March, her father was furloughed from the fracking company where he worked. Both are receiving unemployment checks, but Wise says they’re not sure how long it will be until they can both work again. In the meantime, household expenses pile up.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We’ve stopped spending money, not only because of the quarantine but because, finance-wise, we can’t afford it anymore,” she said. “We’re doing okay. We have food in the fridge, but you just can’t spend when you don’t know when things are going to go back to normal.”\\n\\nBusiness owners say they also are facing a delicate balancing act, weighing the health of their employees against the need to make money. It wasn’t clear, many said, whether customers would even show up once they reopened, but they couldn’t risk staying closed if all of their competitors were open.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Texas, Abbott’s quarter-capacity mandate has left business owners scrambling to determine how, and when, to restart operations, according to Jason Mock, president of the San Marcos Area Chamber of Commerce, near Austin.\\n\\n“Everybody is still wrapping their hands around it,” he said. “There’s still hesitation among some businesses, but others are excited to get back in the game because they’ve been sidelined for so long.\"\\n\\nSome restaurant owners, he said, are wondering whether they can make ends meet with only one-quarter of their seats open to the public. Reopening this week means having to pay for food, utilities and employee wages, with little guarantee that diners will immediately venture back.\\n\\n“It’s tough,” Mock said. “I think it’s probably going to be a slow trickle at first. But owners understand that this is just the first step on the way to how things used to be.\"\\n\\nAt the Luggage Shop of Lubbock, which will reopen Friday, owner Tiffany Zarfas Williams says she is encouraging shoppers to opt for curbside pickup. If they want to shop in person, they can schedule a visit online to ensure that the store never gets too crowded. She’s also stocked up on disposable masks and hand sanitizer for employees as well as shoppers.\\n\\n“I am a little nervous,” Williams said. “I hate being in the state that’s one of the first to reopen — we won’t know until two, three weeks from now whether this was a good idea.\"\\n\\nAs her sales have fallen 90 percent in the past month, Williams has continued to pay her two full-time employees and managed to defer her store’s rent for two months. But she says she’s bracing for a long-term drop in business. It could be months, perhaps years, she says, before consumers feel comfortable spending hundreds of dollars on luggage.\\n\\n“Even once we open, I don’t foresee people just rushing out of the door to shop,” she said. “It’s a challenging time for someone who owns a luggage and travel store. Those are two things nobody is thinking about right now, and I don’t know when that’s going to change. That’s what makes this so difficult: all of the uncertainty.”\\n\\nIn Columbia, S.C., Darius Johnson is preparing to reopen his music-themed smoothie shop Monday after a month-long closure that’s cost him thousands of dollars in lost sales. Johnson, who has four employees, plans to introduce a mobile app so customers can order and pay with their phones. He’s also stocking up on turmeric, ginger and lemon juice, in hopes that health-conscious consumers will be ready to shell out.\\n\\n“It has been a really big challenge waking up each morning and knowing I’m not going to make a single dollar,” said Johnson, 28, who opened the Groove Smoothie & Juice Bar in November. “Of course, ultimately you want to stay safe, but you also have to do what you can to keep the business going.”',\n",
       " '“The stock market was up very substantially today,\" Trump said Monday. \"And people are seeing a lot of good things, a lot of very smart people investing in the stock market right now.” He promised an “incredible” economic comeback later this year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe market’s stunning surge is less a sign that the economy is doing well — it’s obviously not — than an indication that investors anticipate such a swift recovery once the pandemic shutdown ends. The bet is that weak corporate earnings and gloomy forecasts of plunging output are outweighed by a multitrillion dollar Federal Reserve rescue effort.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There is a seemingly unlimited safety net under the economy,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust. “The Fed intervention has been very effective and provided significant confidence for the equity market.”\\n\\nThe stock market’s performance is one of Trump’s favorite economic indicators. But stock ownership is highly concentrated: The wealthiest 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of all stocks. The bottom 90 percent own the rest, many in 401(k) retirement accounts, according to a 2016 study by Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet rarely have Wall Street’s fortunes seemed so divorced from Main Street’s reality.\\n\\nEven as the stock market soared this month, businesses across the country faced collapsing sales, painful layoffs and profound uncertainty about when life would return to normal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInvestors credit the Fed with saving the markets from collapse and preventing a new financial crisis from making the recession worse. As trading seized up amid the initial March panic, the central bank swiftly launched plans to buy massive quantities of government, corporate and municipal bonds.\\n\\nBut even as it did, companies across the country closed in response to government edicts, sending more than 26 million Americans into the unemployment line. The jobless rate is heading toward its highest level since the Great Depression’s 25 percent, a reminder that the central bank’s tools are better suited to healing the financial market than the labor market.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The bulk of the job losses are coming from the one part of the economy with few linkages to markets,” said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research for Barclays. “Small and medium-sized businesses are much harder to help through the financial markets, and they’ve seen their cash flows vanish overnight.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIndeed, the businesses that are the most visible parts of local economies — restaurants, dry cleaners, machine shops — typically do not raise money by selling bonds or short-term notes known as commercial paper to investors.\\n\\nThe Fed is launching a program to lend directly to Main Street businesses that fall in the crack between financial markets and existing small-business programs. But the unusual effort is only getting started.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump administration launched an unprecedented small-business loan program designed to prevent companies from laying off their workers, part of nearly $3 trillion Congress approved to counter the pandemic’s medical and economic toll.\\n\\nBut that program has not worked as smoothly as the Fed’s many market interventions. Amid numerous administrative headaches — and heavily criticized loan disbursements to affluent operations such as the Los Angeles Lakers and Shake Shack — the troubled Paycheck Protection Program has been slow to deliver money to its intended beneficiaries. With renewed funding, it began accepting applications again Monday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe program’s continuing struggles come as Americans brace for the most punishing economic downdraft since the 1930s. The economy probably contracted at an annual rate of -4.5 percent in the first quarter, its worst reading since the end of 2008, according to Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat annualized decline could accelerate to -35 percent through the end of June — a horrific pace that appears worse than the reality since it assumes the three-month plunge continues for the entire year.\\n\\nThe bulls’ case is that the worst will soon be over and the Dow, now about 18 percent below its February all-time record, will reach new heights.\\n\\nIn this view, the pandemic, though tragic and costly, is akin to a natural disaster. Unlike during the global financial crisis in 2008-09, the economy was healthy before the pandemic interrupted its progress. Once the storm passes, workers can return to their jobs and companies can resume growing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This is a one-quarter event, not a multi-quarter or multiyear event,” said Lori Heinel, deputy global chief investment officer for State Street Global Advisors. “We’ll see a very sharp rebound in the second half that will set up the market to go higher.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHeinel acknowledged that parts of the economy — such as the travel and hospitality industries — will remain depressed for some time. Activity may not return to precrisis levels until a coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available.\\n\\nBut those sectors are not that large compared with finance and technology, which should continue to grow. The market could reach a new all-time high by the end of next year, she said.\\n\\nThe market’s month-long rebound assumes the sort of V-shaped recovery the president has often touted. But the rally looks “fragile” to Liz Young, director of market strategy for BNY Mellon Investment Management.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“A lot of things have to fall into place for that to occur,” she said. “And the chance that all of them happen and nothing goes wrong is pretty low.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe stock market’s rebound from its coronavirus crash faces a test this week as companies such as Caterpillar, 3M, Ford and Apple release their first-quarter earnings. And the Commerce Department is expected to report on Wednesday that the U.S. economy turned in its worst performance in a decade during the first three months of the year, thanks to the coronavirus.\\n\\nInvestors also will be watching the Federal Reserve, as its rate-setting committee is scheduled to begin a two-day meeting Tuesday and Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell briefs reporters via video link on Wednesday.\\n\\nHopes for a smooth recovery may be disappointed if the first states to reopen for business stumble or a second wave of infections materializes this fall. First-quarter earnings released so far have been “dismal,” Goldman Sachs said on Monday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We are mild bears here,” said Rajadhyaksha. “We think stocks have gone up way too much, way too quickly.”\\n\\nThe last month’s market rebound also rests on a distressingly narrow foundation, which in the past has signaled trouble ahead.\\n\\nThe five largest stocks — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet — now account for 20 percent of the value of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, topping the March 2000 high set at the peak of the high-tech bubble, according to Goldman.\\n\\nA large number of S&P 500 stocks are trading far below their February peak, lagging the overall index by a bigger amount than usual. Such characteristics in the past have been read as a warning of below-average returns.\\n\\nAs more states allow businesses to reopen, household and corporate debt is likely to weigh on the recovery by depressing spending on new factories and equipment as well as cars and clothing, according to Richard Bernstein, chief executive of an eponymous New York investment firm.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCompanies starved for revenue and workers missing their paychecks will be hard-pressed to pay off what they borrowed during the record economic expansion that ended in March.\\n\\n“We are crushing household and corporate cash flow,” he said.\\n\\nAfter a decade-long borrowing binge, many companies now face higher interest charges as they try to roll over their debts. Companies with the best credit ratings now must pay bondholders about 2.4 percentage points above the U.S. Treasury yield, up from roughly 1 percentage point in late February.\\n\\nMore than 21 percent of consumers surveyed in the final week of March said they expect to miss a debt payment over the next three months, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.',\n",
       " '“I’m on the optimistic end of how quickly we can scale testing up,” said Romer, who won the 2018 Nobel Prize for economics. “I do think there’s a way most people could feel safe returning to what feels like normal life this summer if we do this wide-scale testing.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo far, the nation has tested about 5 million people — or less than 2 percent of the population. Last week, Congress approved an additional $25 billion for testing as part of the latest funding bill, which Romer calls a good start but not enough.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRestarting the U.S. economy isn’t just about government officials clearing certain businesses to reopen. People have to feel safe enough to venture out. Romer says that will happen only when nearly everyone in the country is getting tested on a regular basis and people who are sick are being quarantined.\\n\\n“It’s totally in our control to fix this,” Romer said in a phone interview. “We should be spending $100 billion on the testing. We should just get it going. It’s just not that hard.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe advises starting with screening all health-care and front-line workers in the next month and then scaling up the testing to the rest of the nation this summer by using university labs to process tests.\\n\\nRomer says massive testing is the only viable option for the nation. Otherwise, the economy will limp along, leaving millions of people unemployed and forcing small businesses to shut forever. It could take years to recover from that kind of pain. On the flip side, reopening much of the nation too soon could cause deaths to skyrocket again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTop White House officials voiced support for more testing over the weekend. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday that the Trump administration would “balance” reopening the economy with “more testing\" to “monitor this very, very carefully.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDeborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus task force coordinator, said Sunday that more testing would be needed and that “social distancing will be with us through the summer.\"\\n\\nAs Congress and the White House debate another round of economic relief, it’s unclear how much more money will be allocated for testing. Evidence from China and Germany, which have begun to reopen much of their economies, shows that people remain reluctant to go out and spend again. Subways in China remain half full, big public spaces such as casinos remain nearly empty and economic activity is still way off from normal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough some have balked at the cost of testing every American, Romer points out that the United States is losing at least $500 billion a month from the Great Lockdown. His estimate is more modest than some other economists such as St. Louis Federal Reserve President Jim Bullard, who says the nation is losing $25 billion a day right now. Bullard has also endorsed universal testing as the only way to fix the nation’s health — and economic — problems.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Every month of delay makes the recovery slower — and take longer,\" Romer said.\\n\\nRomer won the Nobel Prize for modeling the U.S. and global economies.

Congress in the past two months has approved nearly $3 trillion in new spending to combat fallout from the virus, a figure that does not include the financial toll for states and cities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAmong the loudest China critics is Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a close White House ally. In recent television appearances, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has called for canceling the U.S. debt with China, slapping a “pandemic tariff” on Chinese goods and imposing unspecified sanctions on Chinese officials.\\n\\n“China needs to pay,” Graham told Fox News earlier this week, accusing the government in Beijing of “gross negligence and willful deception” in its handling of the outbreak.\\n\\nWhile Chinese officials almost certainly will never send the United States a check, analysts said, the mounting demands could put the president and the business community in a difficult position. Efforts to blame China for the pandemic also could further sour relations between Washington and Beijing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPublic opinion toward China has turned sharply negative: 66 percent of Americans hold an unfavorable view of the country, up from 47 percent in the spring of 2017, according to the Pew Research Center. Republican sentiment is especially downbeat, with 72 percent reporting an unfavorable view.\\n\\nFor Trump — who blends criticism of China’s trade practices with lavish praise of Chinese President Xi Jinping — bowing to the anti-China voices in his party carries risks. An open rupture in relations with Beijing could prompt Chinese officials to abandon purchases of U.S. farm goods required by the president’s trade deal with China, a White House priority little more than six months before Election Day.\\n\\nThe business community, meanwhile, worries about calls for a wholesale uprooting of long-established supply networks in China but does not want to end up in a public dispute with China critics in the White House.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe United States also depends upon China for many pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies, further complicating any potential confrontation. The administration so far has talked tough on China without committing itself to any specific proposals.\\n\\n“There’s nobody ever been tougher on China than me,” the president boasted Tuesday. “ … I’ve been very tough.”\\n\\nThose who want him to get tougher have zeroed in on the nearly $1.1 trillion that the United States owes China. Graham said recently that he wanted to start “canceling some debt that we owe to China, because they should be paying us, not us paying China.”\\n\\nThe proposal is an audience pleaser on cable television. But it would be almost impossible to implement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe U.S. debt is not a loan that Washington can refuse to repay. China holds more than $1 trillion of Treasury securities that it purchased on the open market. Those securities carry the U.S. government’s promise of repayment and are a cornerstone of the global financial system.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBuyers of U.S. Treasury bonds essentially loan the federal government money in return for periodic interest payments until their securities mature and are repaid.\\n\\nAn administration refusal to honor the bonds held by Chinese institutions would disrupt trading in the $17 trillion Treasury market and upend markets for stocks, as well. Any selective default would probably cause the government’s borrowing costs to rise — just as its annual borrowing needs quadruple compared with last year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Any attempt at a selective default would damage the safe-haven status of all U.S. Treasury securities, since that would set a precedent for the U.S. government being able to walk away from any of its debt obligations,” said Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China desk. “This could reduce the demand for Treasurys and make it harder for the U.S. Treasury to secure financing for the large amounts of debt it will have to issue in the coming months and years.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere also would be practical difficulties in implementing a debt-cancellation strategy. The Chinese government would hardly remain idle while U.S. politicians debated rendering its Treasurys worthless. Chinese officials could begin selling their holdings before Washington acted and could retaliate in other ways, such as by putting an embargo on critical materials that the United States buys from Chinese factories.\\n\\n“It’s an act of financial war. Let’s not kid ourselves,” said Patrick Chovanec, economic adviser for Silvercrest Asset Management Group.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGraham’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nRelations between Washington and Beijing, already raw after two years of trade conflict, have deteriorated amid the pandemic. Chinese officials have been irked by the president’s occasional public references to the “Wuhan virus,” while U.S. officials bristled at a Chinese propaganda campaign that blamed the U.S. military for the disease.\\n\\n“That makes it much tougher to have the level of coordination between the two governments on health and economic matters that the world needs from the two biggest and most powerful nations,” said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\\n\\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who says a Chinese coverup allowed the virus to spread, has proposed imposing sanctions on Chinese officials and has introduced legislation permitting U.S. citizens to sue China for pandemic damages.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCotton’s bill — and the House version introduced by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) — would lift the sovereign immunity that prohibits most lawsuits against foreign governments. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has introduced similar legislation.\\n\\nMissouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) isn’t waiting for congressional action. Earlier this week, he sued the Chinese government in U.S. District Court in Missouri, seeking “billions of dollars” in damages for the medical and economic toll of the coronavirus.\\n\\n“An appalling campaign of deceit, concealment, misfeasance, and inaction by Chinese authorities unleashed this pandemic,” the state alleged in court filings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSchmitt also named the Chinese Communist Party as a defendant, in a bid to circumvent the prohibition against suing a foreign government. Julian Ku, constitutional-law professor at Hofstra Law School, said U.S. courts have never ruled on the question of the all-powerful CCP’s responsibility for Chinese government actions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut he said that while the case may “embarrass” Chinese authorities, it is unlikely to do much more.\\n\\n“It is a very difficult case,” Ku said. “In general, foreign governments are immune to being dragged into U.S. courts.”\\n\\nDemands to punish China come as the administration remains divided between hard-liners such as White House aide Peter Navarro and officials who worry about a tougher line’s impact on financial markets, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council.\\n\\nMichael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute, said the president is not ready for a dramatic reorientation of his policy toward Beijing. For now, he said, Trump is content to wait for the results of an internal probe of China’s role in the virus.\\n\\n“It’s not time yet for the super-hawks to take over from the president’s trade-focused approach, even though he says he’s ‘unhappy’ with China,” Pillsbury said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House declined to comment on the various Republican proposals.\\n\\nThe anti-China efforts thus far appear largely symbolic. But some House Republicans are discussing possible legislation to require the Government Accountability Office to formally assess China’s financial liability for pandemic-related costs in the United States, said Derek Scissors, a China analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.\\n\\nA GAO cost estimate could become the basis for a new levy on Chinese goods entering the country, a move Scissors acknowledged would involve costs for the United States as well as China.',\n",
       " 'Officials working under Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who must approve the $10 billion loan, have told senior officials at the USPS in recent weeks that he could use the loan as leverage to give the administration influence over how much the agency charges for delivering packages and how it manages its finances, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are preliminary.\\n\\nTrump has railed for years against what he sees as mismanagement at the Postal Service, which he argues has been exploited by e-commerce sites such as Amazon, and has sought to change how much the agency charges for the delivery of packages. (Amazon’s founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus relief passed last month, the Treasury was authorized to loan $10 billion to the USPS, which says it may not be able to make payroll and continue mail service uninterrupted past September. Mnuchin rejected a bipartisan Senate proposal to give the Postal Service a bailout amid the negotiations over that legislation, a senior Trump administration official and a congressional official previously told The Post.\\n\\nThe borrowing terms have only been discussed among both agencies’ leadership and have not been made public because the Postal Service hasn’t officially requested the loan, the two people familiar with the matter said. Mnuchin could still decide not to pursue tough terms as the September deadline nears. The Postal Service would not have to use the entire $10 billion loan at one time, but could borrow up to that amount at any given time.\\n\\nIn discussions with senior USPS personnel, Treasury officials have said they are interested in raising rates on the Postal Service’s lucrative package business, its sole area of profitability in recent years. Treasury also could review all large postal contracts with package companies to push for greater margins on deliveries.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTreasury officials have said they may press the agency to demand tougher concessions from its powerful postal unions — among the public-sector unions that still retain significant leverage in negotiations with the government.\\n\\nThe officials have also said Mnuchin wants the authority to review hiring decisions at the agency’s senior levels, including the selection of the next postmaster general, a decision that until now has been left to the Postal Service’s five-member board of governors.\\n\\nUSPS spokesman David Partenheimer confirmed in an email that the agency and Treasury have begun “preliminary discussions” over the loan, but that the Treasury had not yet asked “to impose any of those conditions on that borrowing authority.” He declined to say whether these or any other terms were under discussion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Treasury spokesman said the department began preliminary discussions on the terms of the loan, but cautioned it was too early to comment on those conversations.\\n\\nAmazon did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe Postal Service has repeatedly drawn on an open $15 billion line of credit Congress authorized nearly 30 years ago, as the agency’s finances have been squeezed by the demise of the traditional mail business and rising pension costs. That loan comes without any terms and low interest rates. USPS has paid down the debt in recent years, but has never fully paid off the loan. On April 1, the Postal Service borrowed another $3 billion to help weather the pandemic, bringing the agency up to $14.4 billion from that line of credit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUsually, the agency’s business decisions are made by its board of governors, who are appointed by the president, and an independent entity called the Postal Regulatory Commission, which ensures that the Postal Service charges rates for its services that cover its costs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf Mnuchin were to gain greater control through the new loan, a slew of Postal Service management decisions, including the terms of major contracts and collective bargaining strategy, could require Treasury’s approval. Hiring and firing of senior executives could be required to be run by Treasury, the two people familiar with the matter said.\\n\\nTrump has taken aim at the Postal Service since early in his tenure, initially urging the agency to double the rates it charges Amazon and other firms for delivery.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe agency has been decimated by the decline in first-class mail over recent decades, but one bright spot has been package delivery. The Postal Service competes vigorously with UPS and FedEx and even Amazon’s own delivery services, and it specializes in the “last mile” delivery to a customer’s home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump frequently repeats the claim that higher package rates on Internet shipping companies — Amazon, in particular — could ease the Postal Service’s financial troubles. The Postal Service repeatedly has defended its arrangement with the e-commerce giant, saying it gets fair rates for the services it provides in a highly competitive environment.\\n\\nHigher Postal Service rates could hurt the USPS by artificially raising its price above those of UPS and FedEx, analysts say. It would also hit Amazon, because the company contracts for “last mile” deliveries more frequently than its competitors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUPS spokeswoman Kara Gerhardt Ross in an emailed statement called the Postal Service “an important partner for us in delivering to communities,” especially during the pandemic.\\n\\n“At the same time, the USPS would benefit from modernizing both their cost attribution methodologies to reflect the past decade’s growth in the competitive package market,” she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFedEx in a statement said it had “long supported” postal reform to give the Postal Service “the ability to adapt and prosper in a rapidly changing market.”\\n\\n“FedEx has consistently urged Congress to give USPS the managerial flexibility needed to compete effectively,” the company said, \"while also holding it accountable to the same rules, market forces and incentives as its private sector competitors.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe familiar mail carriers in the USPS’s iconic blue and white trucks have continued delivering mail and packages to a country under quarantine. The Postal Service remains a vital conduit of information for the dwindling proportion of the population that isn’t online.\\n\\nA Postal Service spokesman said 1,219 workers of the Postal Service’s 630,000-person workforce have tested positive for the coronavirus. Forty-four workers have died, according to the American Postal Workers Union, one of several labor groups that represents USPS employees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Postal Service is projecting a $13 billion shortfall this year because of the pandemic, with mail volume down about 30 percent since the virus forced businesses to scale back advertisements, catalogues and other mail. A jump in package deliveries to homebound customers has not fully compensated for those losses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPostmaster General Megan Brennan asked lawmakers this month for an $89 billion bailout that would include funding to make up for losses because of the pandemic, new money for modernization and $39 billion in restructured debt.\\n\\nThe Postal Service’s plight has recently been attracting the attention of lawmakers in both parties. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told donors on a call last week that he wanted postal unions to make concessions on salaries and benefits to help the Postal Service’s finances. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that relief for the Postal Service should be part of a “Phase IV” stimulus package.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt an Oval Office meeting more than a year ago, Trump decried to aides what he viewed as the dysfunction of the Postal Service and reiterated long-standing grievances about the costly effect on American taxpayers, according to one former senior administration official present at the meeting.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly demanded changes to the agency’s financial structure. Mnuchin took on the cause, and has since been repeatedly briefed on potential solutions, the former official said.\\n\\n“People around [Mnuchin] thought it was crazy because people have been trying to figure this out for years, and it’s very politically challenging,” the former official said.\\n\\nBut the treasury secretary has so far found a career staff at the Postal Service that has resisted his efforts at change. Mnuchin created a task force that released a 74-page study in 2018 that called for some of the same changes Treasury may ask for now, namely cutting labor costs, restructuring third-party service agreements and increasing package rates.\\n\\n“Require price increases, reduce service costs, or exit the business for any mail products that are not deemed an essential service and do not cover their direct costs,” the report recommended.\\n\\nBut the recommendations went nowhere, in part because the agency lacked a quorum on the board of governors. They also faced political opposition in Congress and among union ranks to curtailing postal routes and other services.\\n\\nLast fall, Mnuchin sent his deputies to present a new board largely made up of Trump appointees with a slate of changes that attached terms to the remainder of the Postal Service’s customary $15 billion line of credit, breaking with a nearly five-decade precedent of generous terms of postal borrowing.\\n\\nBut career postal staff balked at the terms and USPS leadership swiftly rejected them.\\n\\n“Treasury is going to want to see some of these recommendations implemented,” said Paul Steidler, a postal expert at the Lexington Institute, a conservative think tank focused on security-related issues.\\n\\nDemocrats say Mnuchin will be making a mistake if he tries to impose stringent terms on the new loan.\\n\\n“If Mnuchin wants to play this kind of game with the Postal Service, I think it is time for the Postal Service to tell him they’re not going to agree to unacceptable conditions, and that means Mnuchin will have on his hands the disruption of services this fall,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who chairs the House subcommittee in charge of postal oversight. “I think it’s time to stare him down and this White House down, and for Congress to decide [if we are] going to stand with the Postal Service as we know it.\\n\\n“This is an essential service and it needs to be treated as such. My hope would be that the Postal will stare him down. If they don’t, it’s tantamount to handing over day-to-day management to the Treasury Department.”\\n\\nConnolly and Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) joined Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) in an April 3 letter to Mnuchin asserting Congress’s oversight authority for the Postal Service.\\n\\n“We strongly urge you to make this loan to the Postal Service in a timely manner, under fair terms that comply with the intent of the Cares Act,” the letter states. “We expect the Treasury Department to fully comply with federal statutes and refrain from setting any conditions that would infringe on the Postal Service’s statutory authorities.”',\n",
       " 'The new weekly total comes on top of 22 million Americans who had sought benefits in previous weeks, a volume that has overwhelmed state systems for processing unemployment claims. Economists estimate the national unemployment rate sits between 15 and 20 percent, much higher than it was during the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. The unemployment rate at the peak of the Great Depression was about 25 percent.\\n\\nThe new weekly jobless claims figure came in around economists’ predictions, which were expected “to be staggering, but not growing, which is a small mercy,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. For comparison, 5.2 million people filed unemployment claims for the week ended April 11.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the coronavirus began spreading in the United States earlier this year, many businesses rapidly began to close. Hotels, restaurants and airlines were hit particularly hard, but few businesses were immune from the economic toll. The problems have only worsened each week, as more Americans reduced their spending and more businesses cut workers because income has fallen so sharply.\\n\\nPollak said many businesses quickly “cut to the bone” when they realized how the pandemic would gut sales. Now, many of the new layoffs stem from businesses like news organizations and tech companies that weren’t directly affected by people staying home but are suffering the consequences of vanishing ad revenue and paid subscriptions.\\n\\n“We see declines across every major industry and state, although the declines hit industries at different times,” Pollak said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, consumer spending, the engine behind the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, has evaporated. If they’re still operating, many offices are working with skeleton staffs and staring down months of dismal revenue.\\n\\nThe White House and Congress have tried to intervene, but with limited impact so far.\\n\\nNew funding for small businesses in a $2 trillion March emergency spending package quickly dried up in the face of overwhelming demand, prompting the Senate to expand funding by $310 billion on Tuesday. The bill would direct an additional $60 billion to a separate small-business emergency grant and loan program. The House approved the measure 388 to 5 on Thursday afternoon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven with all the new government spending, hopes for a sharp economic rebound are fading, overtaken by the public fear of going back to restaurants, movie theaters, schools and gyms. The growing possibility of a W-shaped recovery — in which a resurgence of the virus, or a spike in defaults and bankruptcies, triggers another downturn — has analysts reframing what a reopened or rehabilitated economy might look like.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis year defies historical comparison. In 2020, 28.9 million people have filed for unemployment benefits. Halfway through the fourth month of the year, the figure has already eclipsed the full-year totals of every year but 1982 (30.4 million) and 2009 (29.8 million). At this rate, it will overtake both within a week or so.\\n\\nLess than half of working-age Americans will be earning a wage next month, said James Knightley, ING Chief International Economist.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“In an election year, this means that the call for politicians to reopen the economy is only going to get louder, irrespective of the health advice,” Knightley said.\\n\\nIn five weeks, 9.4 percent of the working-age population has filed for unemployment insurance, said Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab’s director of economic research. That’s about twice the share of the population that lost a job during the Great Recession. In some states, such as Michigan, about one in four workers has filed an unemployment claim in the past few weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The numbers detailing the shock to the U.S. labor market are so large, and cover such a short time, that your first reaction is that they’re a typo,” Bunker said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEmployers are also unlikely to be hiring at the same levels they were before the pandemic. As of April 16, job postings on Indeed were down 34 percent compared with last year, Bunker said.\\n\\nThe job losses, like the epidemic itself, haven’t fallen evenly across the country. In three states — Hawaii, Kentucky and Michigan — about 1 in 4 workers have filed for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks. In Michigan, plant shutdowns and furloughs have ravaged the manufacturing economy, which had only recently recovered all the jobs it lost in the Great Recession.\\n\\nOn the opposite of the ledger sits South Dakota, where Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) has resisted calls to lock down the state’s businesses to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Only 6 percent of the state’s labor force has applied for unemployment benefits. It may be a regional trend: Neighboring Wyoming and Nebraska, and nearby Utah, also have unusually low claims numbers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs part of its sprawling stimulus package, Washington has rolled out relief for millions of households and small businesses struggling to make ends meet. But money for struggling businesses quickly ran dry, and system glitches have prevented $1,200 stimulus checks from reaching some of the neediest.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill to expand the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses by $310 billion, and flood a separate small-business emergency grant and loan initiative by an additional $60 billion.\\n\\nMeanwhile, many low-income veterans and Social Security recipients still haven’t received the stimulus money in their bank accounts, while other IRS checks are going to dead people. People who didn’t file tax returns last year or don’t have direct-deposit information may have weeks more to wait.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, the number of unemployed — about 15 million — was significantly higher than the number who claimed benefits, and the unemployment rate still peaked at just 10 percent. Economists expect the United States to blow by that figure when April’s jobs data are released on May 8.',\n",

Eventually treated like a human diorama by the tourists who traveled to peer at them through the glass triangles of their quarters, the terrestrial astronauts (terranauts?) who volunteered to sequester themselves in a collection of seven mini-biomes were tarred as a naive cult at best, and charlatans at worst.\\n\\n“Spaceship Earth” helpfully deconstructs those accusations, first by delving into the project’s origins in 1960s San Francisco, when a charismatic Oklahoma transplant named John Allen gathered a group of bookish, artistically inclined young people to get things going, whether in the form of experimental plays, a farm in New Mexico or an oceangoing ship that they built from scratch in Oakland, Calif. After sailing the world, learning about global warming and attracting the attention and money of oil scion and environmentalist Ed Bass, Allen hit upon the idea of launching an earthbound test of what might eventually be a colony on Mars or the moon.\\n\\nLuckily for us, Allen and his colleagues were compulsive recorders of their adventures, and one of the Biospherians, a physician named Roy Walford, brought a video camera into the complex. With a wealth of archival material to work with, Wolf does a superb job of sending viewers back into the 1980s and 1990s — whose scratchy, juddering VHS-era production values and “Galaxy Quest”-worthy uniforms might be tough on the eyes, but are note-perfect in conjuring the time period. He also interviews as many surviving participants as he can, giving “Spaceship Earth” a welcome note of self-awareness and perspective (although no one addresses the conspicuous homogeneity of the group). Anyone who fears going stir crazy at a time when going to the store is more akin to scrubbing in for surgery than running a light errand will relate when tensions rise and systems begin to break down; if the Biospherians’ two-year sojourn in the Arizona desert proved anything, it might be just how much a whiff of fresh air can do.\\n\\nThere’s a third-act twist involving a present-day political figure that is so shocking, and strangely prescient, that divulging the details wouldn’t be sporting. Suffice it to say that, in addition to celebrating the energy, enterprise and idealism of America’s postwar generation, “Spaceship Earth” provides a sobering primer in how some dreams die, and others are strangled mercilessly in their cribs.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nBeanie Feldstein, right, and Emma Thompson in “How to Build a Girl.” (IFC Films)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (3 stars)\\n\\nTo every girl who watched “Almost Famous” and “High Fidelity” and bears the scars of trying to shoehorn her inner self into the male protagonist's cramped psyche, “How to Build a Girl” arrives like a soothing, if imperfect, balm.\\n\\nBeanie Feldstein stars as Johanna Morrigan, a 16-year-old British high school student living in a council house with her affably chaotic working class family in Wolverhampton in the 1990s. Fantasizing about romance, escape and literary greatness, she worships at the altar of Sylvia Plath, Jo March and the Bronte sisters, whose pictures — along with other heroes and sheroes — adorn her crammed bedroom wall. Bursting with thwarted potential and an indefatigable sense of her own future greatness, Johanna winds up trying out for a job at a hip London music magazine, eventually taking on the persona of a swashbuckling “lady sex-pirate” and gimlet-eyed critic named Dolly Wilde. As a rock journalist, she must learn on the job: She can quote Ulysses, but she can’t quote the Stones.\\n\\n“How to Build a Girl” is adapted by British essayist Caitlin Moran from her semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, and has been directed with a quippy lightness and madcap dashes of magical realism by Coky Giedroyc. A pantheon of comedic talent — including Sharon Horgan, Lucy Punch and Michael Sheen — shows up in an unexpected gallery of cameos, and the film becomes ever livelier as Johanna adopts increasingly outlandish costumes, seemingly thrown together from scraps of Victoriana and the plumes of retired circus ponies. Her growing confidence as a writer coincides with a burgeoning interest in the opposite sex: She falls in love with a rock star she interviews (nicely played by Alfie Allen) and embarks on an ill-advised affair with an acid-tongued colleague played with louche flair by Frank Dillane.\\n\\nFans of Moran’s Channel 4 comedy series “Raised by Wolves” may wonder why Helen Monks or another British actress couldn’t have played Johanna. The answer, no doubt, lies in the arcana of film financing. Feldstein valiantly tackles the Mids accent to the best of her ability, but even her innate charisma — you can’t take your eyes off her when she’s on screen — isn’t enough to make the viewer forget that it’s an act.\\n\\nThere are moments when Johanna’s meteoric ascent feels too perfunctory and squeakily wholesome to be true; but sooner or later “How to Build A Girl” exacts its comeuppance on a protagonist whose plucky self-confidence begins to sour into arrogance and cruelty. The comedy that Feldstein and the filmmakers find in Johanna’s often disastrous attempts to become herself keeps the movie afloat; what keeps it tethered to reality is the universal drama of a young woman finding her voice without losing her soul.\",\n",
       " 'Age 8+\\n\\n“Absurd Planet” is a nature series that takes a look at some of the world’s most unusual creatures. Like most nature shows, this one contains lots of educational tidbits about animals and their habitats; unlike most, it does so in a comic way with lots of potty humor that will delight young viewers (and may or may not turn off some parents). Expect plenty of shots of animals going to the bathroom, as well as a focus on the less palatable aspects of their lives, such as a segment on the pearlfish and how it lives inside the sea cucumber’s rectum (called a “tushy” and “poo hamper” and more in the show’s language), and one on the dung beetle and its love for “poo” (accompanied by visuals of various types of animal feces). Other than the occasionally puerile humor and iffy-for-some jokes and language, this show doesn’t contain anything too upsetting. The only animals we see dying are ones like bugs and worms, and the camera doesn’t linger on faces or blood (if there is any). “Absurd Planet” also has visible respect for animals and how they live: “Just because something’s weird doesn’t mean it’s not worthy,” sums up Mother Nature. This series may ignite viewers’ curiosity, and it’s an excellent, educational, whole-family bet for families who don’t mind the off-color jokes.\\n\\n(12 19-minute episodes)',\n",
       " \"— Michael O'Sullivan\\n\\nFor slackers, shilly-shallyers and inveterate book-stackers who keep meaning to read Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” salvation is at hand. In a lively, informative documentary of the same name, filmmaker Justin Pemberton lays out the economist’s arguments with lucidity and persuasiveness, using a slew of pop-culture references and charismatic talking heads to help make points that are equal parts illuminating and infuriating. Although “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” was made long before words like “coronavirus” and “covid-19” were the lingua franca, the current state of affairs bolsters Piketty’s essential thesis, which is that the geopolitical movement toward liberal capitalism has not resulted in more democracy or social mobility. If anything, we’ve returned to levels of wealth inequality and inhumane values that characterized pre-Revolutionary Europe at their most cruel and distorted. “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” provides a useful lens through which to examine a time when the social contract feels ripe for rewriting.

The reason is more than slightly preposterous, but it makes this indie rom-com cute — or, rather, cutesy — enough as the two engage in flirty banter and devise impromptu dances during pit stops.

The second is Kris, a troubled 14-year-old white girl (newcomer Amber Havard), who agrees to perform chores for her older neighbor in exchange for leniency after she’s caught breaking into Abe’s house to party with friends. This odd-couple dynamic is familiar, as is the trope of bull-riding as a metaphor for the way life can throw you off balance. (Abe begins to teach Kris to ride a little, and it turns out she likes it.) But this is not a film about a budding rodeo star and her gruff mentor. Rather, it is a lovely and tender rendering of the relationship between a couple of fragile, battered souls, each at different ends of life’s journey.

       " '\\n\\nJuan Gabriel Pareja, seated, in “The Infiltrators.” (Oscilloscope Laboratories)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (3.5 stars)\\n\\nIn the intriguing, marvelously inventive documentary “The Infiltrators,” a young Dreamer named Marco notes that whether he’s called “illegal” or “undocumented” doesn’t really matter. “They’re just other words for being afraid.”\\n\\nBut he doesn’t stay scared for long. As a member of the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, a band of creative and indomitable activists, Marco goes undercover at the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, Fla., where hundreds of nonviolent detainees wait to hear if they will be released or deported. Posing as a naive undocumented immigrant, Marco gets himself arrested by the Border Patrol and sent to Broward, where he proceeds to organize low-priority detainees, advising them on navigating a privatized bureaucracy that otherwise threatens to swallow them whole. Soon he is joined by Viri, who engages in similar activities on the women’s wing of the institution.\\n\\nAs a real-life thriller, “The Infiltrators” is the kind of tense, politically engaged drama that would normally lend itself to an earnest big-Hollywood message picture starring Gael Garcia Bernal, Antonio Banderas and Demian Bichir (with Sam Rockwell as the no-nonsense warden). But in the impressively resourceful hands of filmmakers Alex Rivera and Cristina Ibarra, this absorbing and timely story has found its ideal form. Constructed from interviews with the real-life participants in the events being chronicled — which happened in 2012 — the film uses fabulously staged reenactments to revisit what transpired inside the detention facility, where the detainees are treated like prisoners, and where messages are passed back and forth with the ingenuity of the most sophisticated tradecraft.\\n\\nThere are more than a few pulse-pounding moments in “The Infiltrators,” which also could have been titled “The Exfiltrators,” as one of the film’s chief protagonists, an Argentine landscaper named Claudio Rojas (played in the dramatizations by Manuel Uriza), endures nail-biting news of whether he will be released, and to where.\\n\\n[He stars in a new film about infiltrating an ICE detention center. Now ICE has locked him up again.]\\n\\nReminiscent of a similar hybrid docudrama called “American Animals,” Rivera and Ibarra’s film doesn’t fictionalize fact as much as bring it to vivid emotional life, allowing viewers to enter a world that is usually kept at a politically and psychologically safe distance. Some of the most harrowing scenes in “The Infiltrators” center on Viri, who when she gets herself detained must submerge her own smart, self-possessed persona to convince the guards that she’s illegal. “It wasn’t enough that I had to turn myself in,” she says through tears. “I actually had to . . . become the stereotype we advocated against.”\\n\\n[‘American Animals’ proves true crime can be both entertaining and profound.]\\n\\nIn the years since the events of “The Infiltrators” transpired, the issue of immigration has been exponentially demagogued, racialized and toxified; Rivera and Ibarra remind us that, as imperfect as U.S. policy was back then, at least it was open to incremental but important changes like the Dream Act. This invaluable film gives an unforgettable face to people who for years have been hiding quietly and productively in plain sight — in our neighborhoods, offices, restaurants and classrooms. “A year ago I was reading Kafka,” Marco says as “The Infiltrators” gets underway. “Now I was living it.”',\n",
       " 'Movie critic\\n\\nRating: (3.5 stars)\\n\\n\\n\\nLeah Lewis, left, and Daniel Diemer in “The Half of It.” (KC Bailey/Netflix)\\n\\nMay we stipulate that we can all use a feel-good movie around about now?\\n\\n“The Half of It,” an endearing romantic comedy that gives “Cyrano de Bergerac” a 21st century refresh, is ostensibly a teen movie. But it’s also the self-care we all need. Written and directed with tart intelligence by Alice Wu, and featuring some dazzling breakout performances, this breezy, self-aware and utterly adorable coming-of-age tale keeps one eye on literary and cinematic classics, and the other firmly on a future full of exploration, self-expression and buoyant expectation.\\n\\nBut first, of course, comes the hard stuff. As “The Half of It” opens, the film’s heroine, Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis) is suffering quietly through her senior year in the rainy doldrums of Squahamish, Wash., her ambitions to attend Grinnell College foiled by abiding loyalty to her widowed father (Collin Chou) and her own wobbly confidence. Although she makes extra money writing essays for her less hard-working classmates, Ellie is an outsider, enduring the jeers of car-riding classmates as she huffs and puffs on her bike to and from school. When a sweet, lunkheaded football player named Paul (Daniel Diemer) pays her $25 to write a flowery love letter to a sweet and pretty student named Aster (Alexxis Lemire), Ellie understandably balks. When he ups the price to $50, she’s all in.\\n\\nThus is set in motion a familiar plot of hidden identities, repressed passions and unexpected twists. But in Wu’s assured hands, the expected reversals give way to even more surprises, as Ellie and Paul discover heretofore hidden truths about themselves and each other. Texting wasn’t around when Edmond Rostand wrote the original play in the 19th century. Here, Wu uses it to clever effect, allowing her characters’ inner conflicts to be expressed in real and often contradictory time. Dotting the narrative with hat-tips to Plato, Camus and Sartre — not to mention “Casablanca,” “His Girl Friday” and “Wings of Desire” — Wu keeps the dialogue sharp and the feelings honest, managing to layer in some sincere spiritual questioning while putting her adolescent protagonists through the usual pressures of conformity, class snobbery, peers and parents. (“We are the source of our own hell,” Ellie’s teacher, played by Becky Ann Baker, intones wisely early in the film.)\\n\\n\\n\\nLeah Lewis, left, and Alexxis Lemire in “The Half of It.” (KC Bailey/Netflix)\\n\\nReminiscent of “10 Things I Hate About You” in its winning combination of smarts and romantic fantasy, “The Half of It” provides a fabulous showcase for its young lead actors: Raspy-voiced and flawlessly deadpan behind a pair of wire-rimmed glasses, Lewis seamlessly inhabits a character who may be shy but harbors stubborn faith in her own intelligence. Diemer delivers a delectably funny performance as the dimwitted foil for Ellie’s cerebral bookworm. (For evidence, look no further to the clueless look on his face when he’s gifted with a signed copy of “The Remains of the Day.”)\\n\\nEarly in “The Half of It,” Ellie informs the audience that no one will get what they want in the ensuing story (“Casablanca” is name-checked for a reason). But they will get what they need, in a film that brims with compassion for young characters who are still on the cusp of their most exhilarating and consequential life journeys. Wu suffuses “The Half of It” with supreme generosity, especially when she refuses to give her characters the resolutions they crave, and which similar narratives have taught the audience to crave for them. Instead, she sets them free — to take risks, mess up and figure things out for themselves. In other words, she gives them the happy ending every teenager deserves.',\n",
       " \"— Ann Hornaday\\n\\n“Extraction” has a pretty good pedigree: It’s produced by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (“Avengers: Endgame”), the latter of whom wrote the screenplay, based on “Ciudad,” a 2014 graphic novel the Russos co-wrote with Ande Parks. And although director Sam Hargrave is making his feature debut, his previous work as stunt coordinator for the Russos stands him in good stead here. It’s obvious that he knows his way around an action movie in this entertaining thriller, which stars Chris Hemsworth as a mercenary who takes on what looks like a simple job retrieving the kidnapped son of a drug lord, only to find it’s not so straightforward. Set mostly in and around the streets, markets, slums — and, in one scene, sewers — of Dhaka, Bangladesh, “Extraction” is a sterling piece of escapism, characterized by vivid, visceral mayhem and a nice rapport that develops between Hemsworth and his young charge (Rudhraksh Jaiswal).

Fresh off “1917,” actor George MacKay makes for an intense, slightly demented antihero, and the screenplay, which Shaun Grant adapted from Peter Carey’s Booker Prize-winning novel about Kelly, keeps hammering away at the theme of destiny. “Be the man who you were meant to be,” Ned’s mother — played by Essie Davis, who is married to the director — tells him. At another point, Ned’s nemesis in law enforcement (Nicholas Hoult) says, “You’re not the man who you pretend to be.” In the end, we don’t come away with a clear picture of Kelly, giving the lie to what one character calls “a story with telling.” R.

The first is a quirky history of a now-defunct book-and-gay-pornography emporium that operated two branches in the Los Angeles area for many years before the Internet killed it. That part looks at the shops’ role as gathering spaces during the gay liberation movement and AIDS crisis, offering a simultaneous portrait of the business’s unlikely owners: Barry and Karen Mason, a nice middle-class Jewish couple who fell into their jobs almost accidentally, before becoming known as champions of tolerance. Directed by the Masons’ daughter Rachel Mason, “Circus” is also a bit of a family history as well, looking back at her mother’s initially negative reaction when one of her two sons came as gay. Both narratives are fascinating, but Karen’s journey toward aligning her politics with her personal life is the more inspirational one. TV-MA. Available via Netflix streaming. Contains sexual images and language and some nudity. 86 minutes.\\n\\n— M.O.\\n\\nYou might not be in the mood these days for a movie packed with gruesome death scenes that (mostly) take place within the confines of a single apartment. But if you can get past a few minutes of torture porn and a steady stream of blood, “Why Don’t You Just Die!,” a gore-fest from Russian writer-director Kirill Sokolov, is a moderately compelling drama. Much of the thriller consists of young thug Matvey (Aleksandr Kuznetsov) and middle-aged police detective Andrei (Vitaly Khalev) attacking each other with a dizzying array of conventional and unconventional weapons, from a hammer to a shotgun to a TV set. But as the title suggests, Matvey, after being subjected to increasingly cartoonish violence — and the excruciating use with a power drill — simply won’t die. The filmmaker has a master’s degree in physics, and he puts it to good use in his feature debut, carefully observing the way blood drips and spurts, and designing extravagant experiments that suggest a live-action Wile E. Coyote episode directed by Quentin Tarantino. As frantic, and frankly headache-inducing, as all this savagery is, the punishing fight scenes eventually give way to moments of introspection from Andrei’s broken family, whose deepest wounds lie well below the surface. Which kind of makes “Why Don’t You Just Die!” a Chekhov play for fans of extreme horror. Unrated. Available on various streaming platforms.

With “Beyond the Visible: Hilma af Klimt,” Halina Dyrschka’s incisive documentary, the rest of us now get a chance to witness the vibrant, cosmically-inclined images created by an intellectual and artistic pioneer. Recounting af Klint’s early days as the daughter of an aristocratic naval family and gifted art student, “Beyond the Visible” makes a convincing case that af Klint invented abstract painting long before such nominal groundbreakers as Kandinsky and Malevich. Like the recent film “Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blache,” Dyrschka’s movie tells a revealing and infuriating story about how women’s work gets erased and marginalized by the men who write the histories. But aside from a much-needed correction of the record, the best reason to watch “Beyond the Visible” is simply to see af Klint’s breathtaking paintings — ecstatic concoctions of spirals, coils and biomorphic shapes that evoke the scientific and philosophical questions that consumed her.

Make no mistake: This story of a naturalist (writer-director Noel Marshall, who was married to Hedren) who lives with dozens of big cats — several of whom are said to have attacked the cast and crew during filming — is by no means a well-made movie. But it is a fun watch, despite the seemingly improvised dialogue, thin, incoherent plot and bad acting, which veers from the stiffly awkward to what looks like genuine terror.

       " '\\n\\nAdam Horovitz, left, and Mike Diamond, in front of an early photo of the Beastie Boys (from left: Mike Diamond, Adam Horovitz and Adam Yauch) in “Beastie Boys Story.” (Apple TV+)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (3 stars)\\n\\nIn “Beastie Boys Story,” two of the rap group’s founding members — Mike Diamond and Adam Horovitz — take the stage in an ornate Brooklyn theater to recount how a band that started as a punk-rock stunt became one of the most influential musical forces of its generation.\\n\\nRecounting their 30-year career while a near-constant welter of videos, photographs and ephemera flashes across the huge screen behind them, Diamond and Horovitz revisit their days as teenagers in New York, their merry band of fellow misfits and their friendship with producer Rick Rubin — who was still at New York University when they met him, and who would connect them with manager Russell Simmons. When the Beastie Boys released their first album, “License to Ill,” in 1986, they catapulted to superstardom, a meteoric trip that could only end in tears.\\n\\nWell, yes and no. Trading observations while pacing the stage, Diamond and Horovitz convey the giddy ecstasy of their young, party-hearty days, when the creative ferment they shared with co-founder Adam Yauch was at its most liberated. Recounting how they created famous tracks like “Sabotage,” “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party)” and “Rhymin and Stealin” (which lifted the drum lick from Led Zeppelin’s “When the Levee Breaks”), they also offer candid reflections on how their satirically sexist, juvenile, hyperaggressive stage personas began to seep into real life. Recalling the moment when they kicked drummer Kate Schellenbach out of the band, a now consciousness-raised Horovitz says, “How f---ed up is that?”\\n\\nIn other words, the Beasties grew up — especially Yauch, who embarked on a worldwide spiritual and musical journey that wound up informing an entirely new, synthetic style for the group. The final 20 minutes of “Beastie Boys Story” — which was first conceived as an event to promote Diamond and Horovitz’s memoir “Beastie Boys Book” — are an unabashed and deeply affecting tribute to Yauch, who died of cancer in 2012.\\n\\nLike the live audience at the show in the film, the core constituency for “Beastie Boys Story” are the hardcore fans; more skeptical viewers will probably cringe at Diamond and Horovitz’s awkward teleprompter readings and director Spike Jonze’s occasional interjections from an unseen microphone. Equal parts celebration and self-congratulation, “Beastie Boys Story” might be manna from heaven for completists, but also embeds a spirited social history of American culture in the 1980s and 1990s, when rap was beginning to assume pride of place in the rock-pop pantheon. The Beasties are a crucial part of that transformation — an ambiguous honor when perceived through the lens of their callow and arrogant youth, but one that, in self-aware and humbled hindsight, feels wholly earned.',\n",

       " \"\\n\\nFrom left: Celeste O’Connor, Lovie Simone and Jharrel Jerome in “Selah and the Spades.” (Amazon Studios)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (3 stars)\\n\\nOne of the upsides of our new streaming-only world of movies is the chance to discover emerging talents, filmmakers whose feature debuts might otherwise have gone unnoticed amid the usual Friday onslaught of forgettable theatrical openings.\\n\\nOne such shining light is writer-director Tayarisha Poe, whose movie “Selah and the Spades” marks the arrival of an assured, provocative voice with a richly eccentric vision to match. In this teen comedy presented as highly ritualized political theater, Poe reframes an entire cinematic canon of mean-girl cliques, Tracy Flicks and adolescent shticks to come up with a language — and salient points about female authority, autonomy and self-worth — all her own. With as keen an eye for designing the frame as for casting the characters who populate it, Poe shows enormous promise, both as a storyteller and meticulous scene-maker.\\n\\nWe meet the title character as she is holding court at a tony Pennsylvania private school called Haldwell, which is run by a network of “factions”: groups of students who are in charge of underground student life, meaning everything from cheating protocols to stunningly elaborate pranks. Selah (Lovie Simone) and her crew are in charge of parties, particularly the illicit substances that fuel them. Imperious, unflappable and intimidating, Selah approaches her mission with the no-nonsense drive of a Fortune 500 CEO. But as a senior, her task is to groom a successor, and a new arrival named Paloma (Celeste O’Connor) might be just the raw clay worthy enough for Selah to get her hands dirty.\\n\\nWith its clean staging and coolly mannered style, “Selah and the Spades” reaches back to Wes Anderson, Whit Stillman and even Stanley Kubrick; this is a film in which nearly every image looks worked over and carefully polished, with no detail left unconsidered. Although the interpersonal dynamics of Poe’s world are immediately recognizable, she infuses the production with fanciful, often gorgeously whimsical touches: Even Selah’s trunk, which holds the stash she doles out to her classmates every weekend, is beautifully lit to within an inch of its life.\\n\\n\\n\\nCeleste O'Connor in “Selah and the Spades.” (Ashley Bean/Amazon Studios)\\n\\nAs pleasing as it is simply to watch “Selah and the Spades,” it would be an empty exercise without full-blooded characters: As the impossibly demanding Queen Bee at the story’s center, Simone manages to play Selah’s ruthlessness and vulnerability virtually simultaneously. O’Connor — who like Simone delivers a breakout performance here — is utterly believable as the Eve Harrington of the piece: A soft-voiced dove who might be hiding a talon or two under those delicate feathers.\\n\\nFor all its familiar contours, “Selah and the Spades” feels realistically grounded and surpassingly strange, with its slightly surreal atmosphere growing more foreboding as Selah and the school descend into paranoia, competition and jealousy. Poe may not stick the landing with 100-percent success, but along the way she builds a world of imagination, daring and genuine substance. She gives Selah a magnificent soliloquy early in the film, when she describes the impossibly high standards teenage girls are subjected to as a matter of course; although race is never explicitly invoked in “Selah and the Spades,” it’s woven through the text with gossamer finesse. The fact that Selah’s faction takes its name from an offensive and damaging racist slur, and that Poe never comments on that fact, might be the best proof of all that this is an artist unafraid to take whatever language she’s given — cinematic or social — and use it to tell her own truth, on her own terms.\",\n",

The colors are bright and the mood is light, even though the Riders are on a quest that could be dangerous. Any menace or peril doesn’t linger, and the action is lightened by gentle jokes. Violence is cartoonish, with characters getting pushed over, bonked in the head, attacked by an army of flying bugs and trapped in a cave. There are cannons, and dragons blast each other with fire, water and even golden glitter. But there’s no blood, no death and even when characters are trapped things never seem hopeless. The villains (who all have “foreign” European accents while heroes all sound American) are fun and colorful and not too scary, and the Riders’ quest to save a rare and precious Dragon egg is a noble one. Characters demonstrate courage and perseverance, and the brother-sister pair at the center of the action are brave, loyal and loving to each other. This special is good whole-family viewing for clans with young kids.

The humor ranges from subtle jokes and sight gags to slapstick scenes and potty jokes (burps, farts, etc.). Villains are cartoonishly evil, while the heroes are nearly perfect. The young main characters are brave and smart, and they take on nontraditional gender roles. One scene could cause some tears (possible spoiler alert): A beloved parent is killed in a mine explosion. Viewers see the adult’s face react as he realizes his imminent doom, as well as the child’s fear and sadness as he realizes what’s happened and then mourns his dad. Otherwise, the puppets’ style and silliness mostly minimize the impact of the violent moments — like a villain pointing a gun at the hero, characters being kidnapped, or a young mole using a fire ax to open a vending machine. There are brief kisses, a couple of double entendres (as well as insult language like “loser,” “moron” and “idiot”), and one character uses her sexuality to influence a man to do her bidding. Along with themes of teamwork, perseverance, and courage, the movie offers kids clear messages about following your dreams and believing in yourself.

       " '\\n\\nPhotographer Bill Cunningham shooting a 1971 Paris fashion show from the audience. (Harold Chapman/Greenwich Entertainment/The Image Works)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (3 stars)\\n\\nDoes the world need another Bill Cunningham documentary?\\n\\nYes, it turns out. More than ever.\\n\\nCunningham, the New York Times fashion photographer who died in 2016, has appeared in two previous films, including 2010’s thoroughly engaging “Bill Cunningham New York” and “Lost Bohemia,” which chronicled the artists and eccentrics who occupied the legendary Carnegie Hall Studios. In “The Times of Bill Cunningham,” filmmaker Mark Bozek uses a 1994 interview he conducted with his subject as the scaffolding around which to drape another appreciation of a man whose keen eye, indefatigable work ethic and discerning taste informed a decades-long career documenting contemporary street life. What could be more perfect at a time when the streets are so pointedly and purposefully devoid of life?\\n\\n[Bill Cunningham, photographer of New York street fashion, dies at 87]\\n\\nFans of those earlier films already know what an endearing, engaging character Cunningham was. Over the course of a Q&A session that was supposed to last several minutes and ran until the videotape gave out, he’s just as sprightly and candid as we might expect, recounting his childhood in a conservative Catholic Boston household, his move to New York at 19, becoming a sought-after milliner known for chic, whimsical creations, and finally his introduction to photography in the 1960s, when the gift of an Olympus camera completely changed his life. “It was a revelation,” he says delightedly. “You can’t imagine.”\\n\\n“The Times of Bill Cunningham” revisits well-trod territory, including Cunningham’s famous neighbors at the Carnegie Hall Studios, where he befriended everyone from Marlon Brando and Norman Mailer; no matter. This well-researched dive into mid-century social history treats viewers to a cornucopia of delicious photographs to accompany Cunningham’s narration, plunging us into a world that feels both immediate and heartbreakingly gone forever.\\n\\nFamiliar, too, are Cunningham’s trademark blue workman’s jacket and trusty bicycle, of which he owned several, because they kept getting stolen. The gems in this film are his offhand memories, such as when he recalls never buying clothes in season, because he was getting high-end hand-me-downs from his wealthy clients, or Jacqueline Kennedy asking him to dye a red Balenciaga dress black for her husband’s funeral.\\n\\nThere’s a brief but touching pictorial tribute to Mrs. Kennedy midway through “The Times of Bill Cunningham,” which is punctuated by moments of wordless grief. (Cunningham breaks down in tears when he recalls how many talented friends and colleagues he was losing amid the AIDS epidemic.) Bozek approaches the most sensitive material gingerly: There are no questions about Cunningham’s personal or romantic life, and the fascinating contradiction of his leaving most of his money to AIDS causes and the Catholic church goes unplumbed.\\n\\nStill, “The Times of Bill Cunningham” brims with pleasures, most notably of Cunningham’s own guarded but modest and friendly company. Although he’s self-effacing to a fault, he has real wisdom to share regarding the postwar decline of glamour, which once could be found in Hollywood but transferred to the fashion world. (Hearing him complain about Elizabeth Taylor’s lack of innate style prompts one to wonder what he would make of the stars-are-just-like-us board shorts and Uggs of today’s celebrities.) Most valuably, “The Times of Bill Cunningham” reminds us of a time when public life was a glorious, life-giving jumble of high-low creativity and self-expression, and rubbing elbows wasn’t just a matter of self-distancing. “Wasn’t it grand?” the film seems to exclaim. And what would we give to get back out and mix it up again?',\n",

The filmmakers confront that by introducing new dangers for the elephants, creating moments of suspense throughout the film. These scenes include possible drowning, such predators as lions and hyenas, a baby elephant with his head stuck in the mud, and more. Some could be scary/upsetting for certain viewers, especially when the youngest elephants are put at risk. But the elephants always come through the scares intact until near the end of the film, when one matriarch dies of old age. It’s a tender scene as the herd gathers around her and feels for her last breath with their trunks, covering her eyes with her ear when she’s finally gone. Some viewers, though, may feel uneasy knowing that her body is likely to be attacked by surrounding lions as soon as the herd moves on. Likewise, narrator Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, makes clear that although this herd has survived its perilous journey, not all do. is (88 minutes)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAvailable via Disney Plus streaming.\\n\\nEndlings (TV-PG)\\n\\nStreaming\\n\\nAge 8+\\n\\nCampy sci-fi series has heartwarming themes for families.\\n\\n“Endlings” is a Canadian drama series about a family that protects the extraterrestrial beings and endangered creatures they discover. Some of the creatures look scary, and there are tense moments during which the creatures’ intentions are uncertain. And some of the adult characters do things that suggest they’re motivated by greed and selfishness, at the potential expense of endangered species. On the upside, the family dynamics among the four children and their foster father emphasize communication, respect and empathy. The cast offers a positive array of representations — especially in the case of one character’s physical differences — but rather than being a matter of conversation or analysis, it’s all just part of the family’s reality. The show isn’t superbly acted or animated, but viewers who can forgive that will find plenty to like in its themes about family and conservation.

He’s a misfit whose compassionate character and strong principles earn him disdain from those around him but prove invaluable in fulfilling his destiny. The story raises issues like racial, ethnic and class prejudice, but the characters’ actions ultimately work against bias in positive ways. Characters’ true loyalties can be difficult to figure out, making it hard to decide who’s a hero and who’s a villain. Although the show minimizes the violence that’s common in this genre, you can still expect to see plenty of weapons (swords, knives, crossbows, etc.), as well as intense death scenes — but little blood. There’s some romance between characters; expect kissing and the like. Language is infrequent and typically involves name-calling (“scum,” “idiot,” and “brats,” for instance), as well as “a--” and “dammit.” (Six approximately hour-long episodes)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAvailable via Netflix streaming.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nSidney Flanigan in “Never Rarely Sometimes Always.” (Focus Features)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (4 stars)\\n\\nWith a handful of states using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to deprive women of their right to terminate a pregnancy, “Never Rarely Sometimes Always” arrives as a fervent reminder of the consequences of such cynical sanctimony. In this superbly crafted drama, two teenage girls are forced to navigate a system seemingly designed to foil their autonomy and dignity at every turn: While on paper concepts like parental notification and waiting periods can seem benign — if not downright common sense — in this microscopically detailed portrait, their disastrous implications loom larger with every tick of the clock.\\n\\nAutumn (Sidney Flanigan) is a high school student who looks just as unhappy as most of her peers in an unnamed Pennsylvania town; quiet and reserved, she doesn’t have many friends and isn’t close with her mother and man-child of a stepfather (played by Sharon Van Etten and Ryan Eggold, respectively). Autumn’s closest confidante is her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder), who bags groceries with her at the local supermarket. When Autumn discovers that she’s pregnant, it’s Skylar she turns to — after trying to induce an abortion by punching herself in the stomach and overdosing on vitamin C.\\n\\nThe two travel to Manhattan, embarking on an odyssey that is sure to remind many filmgoers of the searing 2007 Romanian drama “4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days.” In fact, writer-director Eliza Hittman was reportedly inspired to make “Never Rarely Sometimes Always” as a feminist response to what she perceived as the male gaze of that movie. With an unadorned, naturalistic style that heavily favors intense close-ups, Hittman plunges viewers into the subjectivity of her protagonists, whose jumble of feelings — dread and confusion, determination and ambivalence, resignation and relief — play out with every glance and gesture, and very few words.\\n\\n\\n\\nTalia Ryder in “Never Rarely Sometimes Always.” (Focus Features)\\n\\nIndeed, Autumn is such a recessive, cipher-like character — and newcomer Flanigan plays her with such affectless understatement — that it comes as a shock when, in a crucial scene at a women’s health clinic, she finally gives in to the welter of emotions that she’s kept in check for so long. In that single moment, “Never Rarely Sometimes Always” goes from being a very good movie to an outright tour de force, with Flanigan undergoing an astonishing transformation in real time, and bringing the audience to a place that transcends glib moralizing or even more thoughtful equivocation.\\n\\nIf Autumn is the putative protagonist of “Never,” it’s Skylar who emerges as the film’s hero, with Ryder playing her character with just the right blend of angelic self-sacrifice and resolute grit. Although the film never spells out the precise circumstances of Autumn’s pregnancy, it does portray in queasy detail the aggressions — micro and macro — that Skylar is forced to endure on a daily basis, from being creeped on by a customer and assaulted by her manager to deflecting the flirtatious banter of an eager young man (flawlessly played by Théodore Pellerin) on the bus to New York. With “Never Rarely Sometimes Always,” Hittman does an excruciatingly accurate job of conveying the complexities of the abortion debate. But perhaps even more valuably, she portrays the misogynistic social space it takes place in. With empathy and outrage that cut equally deeply, Hittman reminds us: This is a girl’s life in a man’s world.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nKris Hitchen and Katie Proctor in “Sorry We Missed You.” (Joss Barratt/Zeitgeist Films)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (3 stars)\\n\\nOver the course of an enormously productive half-century career, British filmmaker Ken Loach has been one of cinema’s most reliable narrators of the human experience. His 2016 film “I, Daniel Blake” delivered a devastating critique of the privatized public sector, with Loach’s portrait of a communal safety net disintegrating before the eyes of the film’s heart-rending title character.\\n\\nLoach evinces the same powers of observation — and his shrewd eye for spotting unknown talent — in “Sorry We Missed You,” in which a working-class family tries to find autonomy and financial security amid the predations of the gig economy. With its depiction of razor-thin margins (commercial and personal), this absorbing and ultimately shattering portrayal of the costs of a late-capitalist system obsessed with convenience, efficiency and nanosecond precision couldn’t be more timely. At a moment when nearly everyone is relying on e-commerce to get by — while being forced to renegotiate the social contract at its most literal — “Sorry We Missed You” serves as a grim reminder that the contract was rigged from the start.\\n\\nAs the film opens, Ricky Turner (Kris Hitchen) is interviewing for a job with a package delivery service, touted by the boss (Ross Brewster) as a self-starter’s dream. Dazzled by promises of independence and generous daily payouts, Ricky agrees to buy one of the company’s white vans, a gambit that immediately puts him into debt to his employer. Thus begins an increasingly breathless race to perform and, finally, just to keep up. While Ricky puts in more and more hours, his wife (Debbie Honeywood) puts in her own hours as a home health-care worker, keeping track of their children (Rhys Stone and Katie Proctor) via texts and voice mails.\\n\\nWorking from a script by frequent collaborator Paul Laverty, Loach ratchets up the tension with nerve-racking intensity Although the film is set in the dispiriting environs of Newcastle’s most featureless neighborhoods, the filmmaker takes care to inject his own brand of warmth and humor: Fans of Loach’s delightful 2009 comedy “Looking For Eric” will particularly appreciate a hilariously profane argument between Ricky, a die-hard Manchester United fan, with one of his customers.\\n\\nThe putative subject of “Sorry We Missed You” is the surveillance economy and the current state of labor. (“What happened to the eight-hour day?” a former union organizer laments at one point.) But the heart and soul of the film is Ricky’s family, which comes dangerously close to fraying beyond repair. With her alert, spirited performance, Proctor is the film’s breakout star, her young Liza Jane observing the chaos engulfing her parents with barely contained distress.\\n\\nAs small catastrophes cascade into bigger ones, “Sorry We Missed You” takes on the usual contours of a Ken Loach film. He’s too honest to deliver false happy endings, but he doesn’t slather on the melodrama for sentimentality’s sake. In this unsparing but deeply compassionate film, viewers get a chance to see the fatigue, stress and bewilderment of modern life for what they are: not the regrettable side effects of market-driven progress, but the results of cynicism and greed, and the unfathomable human cost of wanting what we want, right now.',\n",
       " 'Age 8+\\n\\nLighthearted, nostalgic tween comedy; some language.\\n\\n“The Sandlot” is a lighthearted baseball comedy that tweens will love. Set during the early 1960s, it follows a new kid in town who makes friends by joining a local pickup team. The main threat to the gang’s happiness is “the beast”: a giant, slavering dog on the other side of the sandlot fence (he might briefly scare younger viewers). Strong language includes “s---,” “a--hole” and lots of colorful insults, and there are some scuffles between the boys. Adults may raise an eyebrow at the way the movie treats Wendy, the much sought-after, slightly older lifeguard “babe.” The boys ogle her with typical preteen interest (and one tricks her into kissing him), but it’s the camera that unnecessarily lingers on her various body parts. Family relationships are also somewhat strained (particularly between one of the boys and his indifferent stepdad), but friendship plays a strong role and comes off in a very positive light. And overall, the movie has a sun-kissed, nostalgic tone that both kids and parents will appreciate.

There’s lots of emotional intensity here, of the “who will win?” variety. The movie also deals with alcoholism but features the redemption of two adult leads. There’s some swearing, including “s---” and “Jesus” (as an exclamation). Players get into confrontations during games, including a bench-clearing brawl at the sectional championship. One fight results in a bloody injury that requires stitches. Strong positive messages include not judging a book by its cover, giving people second chances and the importance of hard work, discipline and teamwork.

Expect some innuendo and sex talk (Madonna’s character is referred to as “All the Way Mae”) and a bit of swearing (“s---,” “penis with a hat on”), as well as drinking (Hanks’s character is often drunk) and smoking. Men admire the girls in their skimpy uniforms. Some sexual references: “pickle tickle,” a comment about girls being better suited for sex than baseball, a reference to “the clap.” Shots of women in their underwear.

       " '\\n\\nVlad Ivanov in “The Whistlers.” (Vlad Cioplea/Magnolia Pictures)\\n\\nRating: (4 stars)\\n\\nFeaturing a femme fatale, a corrupt cop and an eclectic soundtrack that opens with Iggy Pop’s 1977 “The Passenger,” the Romanian crime drama “The Whistlers” includes elements that could have been plucked from almost any Tarantino-esque bloodbath. But coming from director Corneliu Porumboiu, whose last film was the slow-as-molasses soccer documentary “Infinite Football,” it is a drastic — and exciting — departure from expectations.\\n\\nThe ornate plot revolves around Cristi (Vlad Ivanov), a veteran police detective who has agreed to help a group of mobsters spring a big-time criminal from a Bucharest prison. The escape plan is hatched in the Canary Islands, where Cristi meets his co-conspirators, learning to communicate by means of Silbo Gomero, an esoteric whistling language native to the island of La Gomera (the film’s Romanian title).\\n\\nOf course, there is money is at stake — a cool $30 million — but Cristi is motivated by something else: the beautiful Gilda (Catrinel Marlon), who recruited him for the job, and whose history with the police officer is, let’s say, complicated.\\n\\nIvanov is perfect in the role of world-weary detective, and his casting is also weirdly apt. In Porumboiu’s 2009 film “Police, Adjective,” the actor played another cop: a police chief who, in a climactic scene, spends nearly 20 minutes defining the word “conscience” for the benefit of one of his underlings (coincidentally also named Cristi). Such a long, patience-testing sequence would seem tonally out of place here, but “The Whistlers” plays, in some ways, like an extravagant — and sobering — sequel to the earlier film. Here, the director returns to a fascination with both language and corruption, the difference being that the moral arbiter of the previous film is now someone who has fallen from grace.\\n\\n\\n\\nVlad Ivanov, with his head on hood of car, in “The Whistlers.” (Vlad Cioplea/Magnolia Pictures)\\n\\nFor anyone who knows Porumboiu’s other films well, there’s plenty of resonance to be found between them and “The Whistlers.” Newcomers, for their part, will enjoy plenty of dazzling scenery and plot twists in a humorous film that simultaneously revels in action movie tropes while slyly subverting them. Even when the director resorts to outright cliche — the climactic use of “Carmina Burana,” for instance, one of the most overused pieces of music in cinema — it’s clear that he’s commenting on its familiarity. At the same time, though, Porumboiu finds a way to make it new again, incorporating the music into an immensely effective visual spectacle.\\n\\nFans of the director may be a little mystified by what at first seems like something of a commercial sellout, by a director known for more challenging material. And indeed, “The Whistlers” has more than enough sex and violence to satisfy the average action movie fan. But dig a bit deeper, and you’ll find a mother lode of meaning just below the surface.\\n\\nIt’s almost like a whistle that, to the untrained ear, sounds like a bird, but to those fluent in Silbo Gomero, is rich with additional meaning.',\n",

Gelman plays an acting teacher beset by problems in art, love, career and every other life category you can mention.

       " 'A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon (G)\\n\\nAge 5+\\n\\nDelightful family-friendly sequel has positive themes.\\n\\n“A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon” is a stand-alone stop-motion sequel to “Shaun the Sheep Movie” and a spinoff of Aardman Animation’s short-form TV series. Brimming with positive messages — teamwork, friendship and inclusiveness — and with a sci-fi twist, it’s a great pick for the whole family. As with the first movie, there’s no spoken dialogue, just expressive sounds from Shaun (voiced by Justin Fletcher) and his friends, interspersed with a musical soundtrack. Violence is slapstick and cartoonish — characters are hit in the face with food and a flying disc, etc. — but there are some moments of peril, danger and separation (from parents) that may frighten very young viewers. Agent Red (Kate Harbour) is deliberately sinister as the movie’s villain who’s determined to capture an alien named Lu-La who arrives on Shaun’s farm (Amalia Vitale). But even her behavior is later explained sympathetically. A van, a harvester and a UFO all crash at different points in the movie, but no one is harmed. Lu-La is separated from her extraterrestrial parents, which may cause distress to some. There is some toilet humor, such as when Lu-La belches so loud that she’s heard across the globe. The end credits include a brief a glimpse of the Farmer’s (John Sparkes) buttocks, and a photo shows two nude adults with their sensitive areas covered by carefully positioned fingers and thumbs. (86 minutes)\\n\\nAvailable via Netflix streaming\\n\\nFrozen II (PG)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAge 6+\\n\\nSlightly darker sequel charms with catchy songs, messages.\\n\\n“Frozen II” — the sequel to Disney’s 2013 blockbuster — continues the adventures of Arendelle’s magical Queen Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel); her kind sister, Anna (Kristen Bell); and everyone’s favorite snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad). This time around, the characters undertake a dangerous journey to a mysterious enchanted forest, hoping to discover the source of Elsa’s powers. The sisters learn more about their parents’ deaths and backgrounds; thanks to several flashbacks, viewers may feel even sadder about the orphans’ loss. While there’s lots of humor (thanks, Olaf!) and — of course — big musical numbers, the sequel is ultimately a bit more intense than the original. Expect perilous (though never graphic) scenes of elemental spirits chasing and attacking Arendelle/the main characters with wind, water, fire and more. There are also chases, battle scenes with swords, dark secrets and — spoiler alert! — a couple of upsetting (but temporary) deaths. Underlining everything are positive messages about sisterhood, empowerment, acceptance, tolerance, perseverance and true love, and both Anna and Elsa are examples of strong women who lead confidently and communicate with and support each other.

After Lance accidentally drinks Walter’s invisibility concoction and is turned into a pigeon, the odd-couple duo must work together to save the world from a frightening villain who’s using Lance’s face to commit criminal acts. There are lots of action sequences involving spy gear and weapons as well as some life-or-death scenes in which it looks like all is (almost) lost. The physical comedy includes some rude humor (jokes about bird genitalia, for example), and there’s a long scene in which a large, tattooed villain’s naked behind is visible a few times. A female pigeon frequently flirts with Lance in his bird form. The chemistry among the voice actors is great, and the film has worthy messages about teamwork and accepting help from others. And for all of the action, it also promotes nonviolent (or at least nonlethal) means of negotiating and stopping criminals.

There’s frequent cartoonish violence, with characters hurled into space or “poofed” into cotton candy-like clouds, and viewers hear about mortal danger (e.g., characters have 37 hours to save the Earth) but only see a few drops of blood. One critical fight involves a character merely defending himself instead of fighting back at an angry enemy, which helps defuse her anger. Expect plenty of positive, heartfelt themes that are illustrated with visuals and songs about friendship, autonomy and kindness; characters admit and learn from their mistakes. Romantic content includes a moment in which a female friend kisses Steven and he blushes; two female characters dance together and sing a song about love. Language is infrequent, but at one point a character calls another a “dingus,” and there are two uses of “heck.” Parents may want to watch along with kids — and may be surprised to find depth and emotional intelligence in this uplifting movie.

       " '\\n\\nMargo Martindale in “Blow the Man Down.” (Jeong Park/Amazon Studios)\\n\\nMovie critic\\n\\nRating: (3 stars)\\n\\nWhile theaters close and studios scramble to cancel, delay or otherwise find alternative release strategies for their 400-pound gorillas, there are perfectly smart, entertaining, handsomely produced films that were heading to streaming anyway. Case in point: “Blow the Man Down,” a clever slice of regional noir that carries a gale-force punch beneath its modest, soft-spoken trappings.\\n\\nIn the seaside village of Easter Cove, Maine, sisters Priscilla (Sophie Lowe) and Mary Beth Connolly (“Homeland’s” Morgan Saylor) have just buried their beloved mother. While the dutiful Priscilla intends to maintain the family seafood shop and live in the house where she grew up, Mary Beth has no intention of staying; she’s lighting out for more promising climes, after she stops by one last time at the local watering hole.\\n\\nA final nightcap turns into something far darker in a story that becomes a subtly comic murder mystery and feminist parable. Cozier than “Blood Simple,” more perverse than “Murder She Wrote” — with a dash of “Lysistrata” thrown in for some sly sexual table-turning — “Blow the Man Down” isn’t a whodunit as much as a will-they-get-away-with-it caper, given even more ironic humor by its quaintly innocent setting.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom left, Morgan Saylor, Sophie Lowe and Margo Martindale in “Blow the Man Down.” (Jeong Park/Amazon Studios)\\n\\nWriting-directing team Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy make a smashing feature debut with a film that obeys the most cherished crime-thriller conventions while infusing them with just the right amount of stylization and personal commentary. Enlisting a murderers’ row of actresses that includes Margo Martindale, June Squibb and Annette O’Toole, they’ve imagined Easter Cove as a matriarchal society in which the seafarers and law enforcement officers who think they’re in charge are really pawns in a far shrewder game; a recurring Greek chorus of shanty-singing fishermen gives “Blow the Man Down” a piquant touch similar to the musicians in last year’s wonderful Icelandic film “Woman at War.”\\n\\n[Review: ‘Woman at War’ is a taut environmental thriller with a charismatic superhero]\\n\\nLowe and Saylor are utterly convincing as sisters who snipe at each other with reflexive regularity, but have each other’s backs in the end. Finding out just how far that loyalty extends becomes just as important as the MacGuffin itself in “Blow the Man Down,” which ends on a wry note of cheerful menace. In its own gentle but sure-eyed way, this movie cuts deliciously deep.',\n",
       " 'But the formal conclusion of Mueller’s work in the spring of last year was not the ultimate resolution of his efforts. In the months since, a number of the charges he and his team obtained have been questioned, scaled back or dropped entirely. On Thursday, perhaps the most significant of those changes occurred: charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn were dropped, despite Flynn’s having admitted to misleading prosecutors under oath.\\n\\nThat the shifts in the fate of those targeted by Mueller’s team follow the confirmation of William P. Barr to serve as attorney general in February of 2019 is probably not a coincidence. That the subsequent actions seem to reflect Trump’s view of what took place probably isn’t either.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere’s what’s happened to each of those targeted by Mueller, in order of their indictments or plea agreements. Those whose fates may have shifted as a result of Trump’s or Barr’s intervention are highlighted.\\n\\nFormer campaign adviser George Papadopoulos: Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017 and served about a month in prison in late 2018. His attorneys have asked Trump for a pardon.\\n\\nFormer Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort: Saw a number of charges from 2017 dropped after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice in September 2019. The previous month, he was convicted in criminal court of bank fraud and filing false tax returns. He began serving a term in prison in April 2019 and is slated for release in 2024. There’s been ongoing speculation, though, that he’ll be pardoned by Trump. The president has publicly offered sympathy to Manafort.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer deputy campaign manager Rick Gates: Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the U.S. in February 2018, with a number of other charges dropped as a result. He was sentenced to 45 days in prison after agreeing to aid prosecutors. In April, a judge suspended the sentence due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in detention facilities.\\n\\nFlynn: After pleading guilty to making false statements in December 2017, Flynn’s sentence was repeatedly deferred. Trump repeatedly expressed sympathy for Flynn and hinted about pardoning him.\\n\\nEven before Flynn pleaded guilty, Trump was focused on an exoneration for his former aide. Former FBI director James B. Comey testified that Trump asked him to go easy on Flynn only months after Trump took office.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBusinessman Richard Pinedo: Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018 and served a month in prison later that year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Russian online disruption firm Internet Research Agency and 13 IRA employees: Charges of conspiracy to defraud the U.S., identity theft and fraud which were included in a February 2018 indictment remain unresolved. The individuals targeted by the indictment are Russian nationals and extradition is extremely unlikely.\\n\\nConcord Management and Concord Catering : Barr’s Justice Department dropped charges of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. against these alleged shell companies, which had helped fund the IRA, according to the indictment. The department’s concern was that the firms were using the judicial process to uncover information about the government’s information collection processes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBanker Alex van der Zwaan: A former colleague of Gates and Manafort, van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to making false statements, served about a month in prison in 2018 and was then deported.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nManafort colleague Konstantin Kilimnik: Charged along with Manafort in June 2018 for obstruction of justice focused on an attempt to subvert the Mueller investigation. Kilimnik is a foreign national living in Russia and is not likely to face trial.\\n\\nAlleged Russian intelligence agents: Twelve individuals allegedly associated with Russia’s military intelligence arm were indicted on a charge of hacking the Democratic National Committee and the email account of 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. Combined, they face more than 100 individual counts — but, as with the IRA agents and Kilimnik, will likely not face trial.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer Trump attorney Michael Cohen : Facing federal charges independent of the Mueller probe, Cohen flipped on Trump, revealing details of hush-money payment then-candidate Trump made to two women shortly before the election. He additionally pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his activity before the election. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLike Gates, Cohen sought approval to leave prison early out of concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic. That approval was granted — and then rescinded, for unclear reasons. Asked if the White House had intervened to prevent Cohen’s release, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on May 1 that it was “absolutely not” the case that it had.\\n\\nShe then pivoted to talk about the grave injustice the White House saw in the Flynn case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone : Stone was convicted last November of offering false statements and witness tampering. As his sentencing loomed, prosecutors requested a sentence of between seven to nine years.\\n\\nShortly after Trump publicly criticized that request, the Justice Department rescinded it, opening the door for a lighter sentence. The prosecutorial team that had obtained the conviction against Stone resigned from the case, with one quitting the department entirely.\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'In a surprise, the Justice Department on Thursday moved to drop its two-plus-year-old prosecution of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn had been awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to lying to investigators about his calls with Russia’s ambassador in late 2016, and he later reaffirmed to a judge that he had knowingly lied. But Trump’s allies in recent days seized upon documents released by Flynn’s legal team that showed an FBI official musing about whether investigators had the goal of getting Flynn to lie.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe judge, Emmet G. Sullivan, still has to make a decision about whether to grant the motion. But the move could notably spare Trump a difficult political decision about whether to pardon Flynn on the eve of the 2020 election.\\n\\nThe move also coincided with the abrupt withdrawal from the case of the lead Justice Department lawyer. The lawyer, Brandon L. Van Grack, had been a part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s team, which brought the case against Flynn.\\n\\nThe reasons for Van Grack’s withdrawal notice weren’t immediately clear, but it carries a strong parallel to the other recent case in which Barr’s Justice Department reversed course in favor of a Trump ally — and after Trump publicly suggested it do so. Back then, it was the prosecution of longtime Trump political adviser Roger Stone, in which the Justice Department abruptly watered down its initially tougher sentencing recommendation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump had tweeted about the allegedly unfair recommendation earlier in the day.\\n\\nThe night before, he also retweeted a suggestion that it was too tough.\\n\\nAnd Trump had also defended Stone repeatedly in the months prior.\\n\\nAfter the DOJ’s reversal on Feb. 11, all four career prosecutors handling the case, including two from Mueller’s team, withdrew from it, and one left the Justice Department entirely. Officials described disagreements about the sentencing recommendation and said the prosecutors’ superiors had been blindsided by it. But the withdrawals reinforced the turmoil within the Justice Department over the potential politicization of what are supposed to be independent prosecutions that happen to involve Trump and his allies. And lurking behind it all was a series of Trump-friendly actions Barr had taken, including, most notably, in the aftermath of the Mueller-led Russia investigation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarr came to acknowledge the problem — with the appearance, at the very least — of Trump’s comments preceding such Justice Department action. And he took the highly unusual step of publicly urging the president to knock it off.\\n\\n“I think it’s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,” Barr said in an ABC News interview shortly after the Stone reversal. He added that Trump’s tweets about such situations “make it impossible for me to do my job.”\\n\\nReports indicate he had even talked about resigning over the situation.\\n\\nBut Trump didn’t, in fact, stop tweeting about Justice Department matters or even those involving his own allies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe has since retweeted lots of suggestions that Flynn had been unjustly targeted and also said it in his own words as recently as last week.\\n\\n“What happened to General Michael Flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!” Trump tweeted April 30, after the new documents came to light.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe said the same day that “General Flynn was treated like nobody should — and I’m not talking about generals; I’m saying like nobody in this country should be treated.”\\n\\nHe added the next day in an interview, “It’s a disgrace what happened to General Flynn. It’s a — it was a setup from Day One.”\\n\\nThe documents indicate that FBI officials believed they had damning evidence against Flynn, in the form of transcripts of his calls with the Russian ambassador. Notes indicate they were deciding whether to allow him to lie as he had done previously to the White House — and which Trump himself has acknowledged — or to present Flynn with that sensitive evidence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRegardless of whether that approach was the correct one and whether the prosecution was appropriate, what’s clear is that despite his attorney general’s three-month-old exhortation that Trump should stop weighing in on such situations, Trump continued to do so — and now he has gotten yet another outcome that will meet with his express approval.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarr is again stepping forward to defend taking actions on Trump allies that align with Trump’s own desires. He tells CBS News in a new interview, “I want to make sure that we restore confidence in the system. There’s only one standard of justice. And I believe that … justice in this case requires dismissing the charges against General Flynn.”\\n\\nBut Barr’s comments seem to very publicly acknowledge how problematic this all looks — again.',\n",
       " 'President Trump’s campaign is seeking to weaponize this case against the Democrats’ presumptive nominee. But it’s also a complicated allegation. Let’s break down what we know about it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe timeline of the alleged assault and the allegation\\n\\n1993: Former vice president Joe Biden was then a powerful senator, having been in the Senate for 20 years. At the time, he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Tara Reade, 28, joined the office in late 1992 in an entry-level staff position. One of her duties was managing interns.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpring 2019: Biden prepares to run for president, and about half a dozen women share stories of unwanted touching by Biden that they said made them feel uncomfortable. Biden said his intention was to offer affection and comfort as a politician but recognized that times had changed and promised to be more respectful. He did not apologize and joked about the criticisms a few days later.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nReade was one of those women, saying that at least three times, Biden put his hands on her shoulders and the base of her neck. She also said she was asked to serve drinks at a reception and overheard a colleague suggest it was because she was pretty and Biden liked her legs. She told The Post she complained to supervisors and was asked to look for another job. In an interview with The Post at the time, she does not mention sexual assault, and she gives varying reasons for her departure from his office at other times.\\n\\nEarly 2020: Voting in the Democratic presidential primaries gets underway, and Reade is a vocal supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), although she told The Post that politics didn’t factor into her decision to make the allegation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarch: Biden shores up the Democratic nomination, and Reade gives an interview in a podcast in which she makes the sexual assault allegation. She said she was delivering Biden a gym bag somewhere in the Capitol area (which has multiple buildings) but doesn’t remember exactly where. She said Biden pinned her against a wall, reached under her skirt (she said she wasn’t wearing any stockings) and pushed his fingers inside her. From her interview in April:\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“He put me up against the wall and took the bag,” she said. “He reached up underneath my skirt … I remember two fingers … It was such a nightmare.” She said he asked, “Do you want to go somewhere else?” She said that when she pulled away, he said, “Come on, man, I thought you liked me,” then told her that she meant “nothing” before finally grabbing her shoulders and saying, “You’re okay.\\n\\nBiden’s campaign denies this ever happened.\\n\\nApril 12: The Post and the New York Times both publish investigative reports on the same day. Both reports find a friend who anonymously corroborates Reade’s story, but they also find half a dozen to a dozen former staffers at the time who do not recall something like this or any other assault allegation taking place.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nApril 24: A 1993 clip of a Larry King CNN show surfaces. A woman who called in to the show that year, identified as from the city where Reade’s mother would have been living at the time, said her daughter was having “problems” with “a prominent senator” and wanted suggestions other than going to the press. She did not mention any names nor give details. Reade has since heard the recording and said it was her mom, who died in 2016.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nApril 27: Business Insider reports that Reade’s neighbor in the mid-1990s said that Reade told her Biden had “put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her,” which is what Reade accuses Biden of doing. This neighbor was willing to go on the record with her name. “I remember talking about it,” Lynda LaCasse told Business Insider. LaCasse lived next to Reade in California in 1995-1996, where Reade moved after working in Washington. She confirmed her comments in a text message to The Post, saying she is “a very strong Democrat and am supporting Joe Biden during this election.”\\n\\nReade told The Post that after it happened, she told her mother, her brother and a friend but did not mention a neighbor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nReade went on to work for a California state senator, and Business Insider talked to a former staffer at the time, Lorraine Sanchez, who said Reade told her that a former boss in Washington, D.C., had sexually harassed her and that she had been fired after raising concerns. Sanchez did not recall whether Reade specifically mentioned Biden. Sanchez did not respond to messages from The Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMay 1: In a statement and an interview with MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski, Biden denies the accusation and urges the Senate to look up his records for any complaint Reade may have filed against him.\\n\\nMay 7: Reade responds in an interview with former Fox News and NBC anchor Megyn Kelly. “You I were there, Joe Biden,” she said when asked what she would say to him. “Please step forward and be held accountable. You should not be running on character for the president of the United States.” She says she would go under oath and that she would take a polygraph test if Biden took one.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat Biden has said\\n\\nBiden issued his statement minutes before he addressed the allegation publicly Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” saying: “It’s not true. I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn’t. It never happened.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe also said that no one on his staff raised such a complaint to him.\\n\\nBiden said if Reade filed a personnel complaint at the time, it would be in the National Archives, and he urged the National Archives to search for any such complaint.\\n\\n“I’m confident there’s nothing. No one ever brought it to the attention of me 27 years ago, any assertion at all. No one that I’m aware of in my Senate office at the time is aware of any such request or any such complaint,” he said. He added: “This is an open book. There is nothing for me to hide at all.”\\n\\nVetting the allegation\\n\\nSexual assault allegations are almost always difficult to assess for credibility. Because the act in this allegation took place decades ago, and because Reade initially came out with a different story about what happened, this one is also complicated.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLast year, Reade said Biden’s touching of her neck and shoulders made her feel uncomfortable. But she did not make any mention of sexual assault, which is far more serious. In fact, she appeared to defend Biden: “This is what I want to emphasize: It’s not him. It’s the people around him who keep covering for him,” she told The Post at the time. She added: “For instance, he should have known what was happening to me.… Looking back now, that’s my criticism. Maybe he could have been a little more in touch with his own staff.”\\n\\nA few people have corroborated parts of Reade’s accounts. Her former neighbor in California went on the record this week confirming Reade’s story, saying she is sure she heard about it a few years after Reade alleges the assault occurred. Reade told The Post that she told her mother (who died), her brother (who initially told The Post he heard a different story that did not involve sexual assault and days later texted to say he remembered hearing Biden put his hand “under her clothes”), and a friend (who anonymously corroborated hearing her assault story).\\n\\nReade said she complained to three supervisors at the time in the Biden office. All three said they don’t remember any complaints from her. One, Biden’s executive assistant at the time, Marianne Baker, put out a statement via the Biden campaign specifically denying Reade’s allegation:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn all my years working for Senator Biden, I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period — not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone. I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade’s accounting of events, which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional, and as a manager.\\n\\nReade also says there is a paper trail, but journalists have been unable to locate a central piece of that. She said she filed a complaint with a congressional human resources office about her treatment in Biden’s office — but not about the assault allegation — in 1993. She said she does not have a copy of the complaint, and The Post could find no record of it. The office she probably would have filed a complaint with has since morphed into a different office.\\n\\nIt’s possible that corroborating evidence of the complaint could be found in Biden’s archive at the University of Delaware, but the university said these papers will be sealed until two years after Biden retires from public life — unless he were willing to release them.\\n\\nOn Friday, Biden said the papers at the University of Delaware actually contain his public speeches and papers and transcripts of private conversations with world leaders, not personnel documents related to the management of his Senate office. Biden said personnel records would be at the National Archives, which houses old Senate papers, and called on them to release any record of Reade’s complaint. He wrote a letter urging the Secretary of the Senate to take “whatever steps necessary” to search his records, but on Monday, the secretary said the law prohibits releasing such records.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen pressed on MSNBC to do a search at the University of Delaware for Reade’s name, Biden maintained that all personnel issues are at the National Archives and worried that the release of his records relating to being in public office could be taken out of context in his presidential campaign.\\n\\nReade said she filed a police report this April after talking to The Post and Times about the alleged incident because she was being harassed online about it. The report repeats what Reade has said publicly: “Subject-1 disclosed that she was the victim of a sexual assault which was committed by Subject-2 in 1993.” D.C. police say the investigation is inactive. Filing a false police report is a crime.\\n\\nReade told The Post she told a therapist earlier this year about what she says happened. The Post asked Reade for the therapist’s notes of that conversation, but she has not produced them.\\n\\nBeyond the paper trail and corroboration, another thing that would bolster the accusation is if there is evidence of a repeated pattern of sexual misconduct by the accused. Extensive investigations by some of the nation’s best journalists have thus far found no other accusers of Biden but did turn up denials by staffers who worked for him at the time that something like this could happen. By contrast, more than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual assault or groping, and he is on tape bragging about such behavior.\\n\\nThe thorny politics for Biden and Democrats\\n\\nBiden is the leading figure of a party that has striven to present itself as the antithesis to Trump, including — perhaps especially — when it comes to Trump’s behavior. As such, Democratic Party leaders have tried to position themselves as having a zero-tolerance policy toward sexual misconduct. Democratic senators pushed out Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) in 2018 after he faced multiple accusations, which he denied. Later that year, the party opposed Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court after he was accused of sexual assault when he was in high school.\\n\\nBiden told reporters at the time that society should generally presume a woman alleging sexual assault is telling the truth: “For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it’s been made worse or better over time,” he said.\\n\\nThere are mixed perspectives in the Democratic Party about how to approach the accusations against Biden, six months before the presidential election. The main question Democrats seem to be struggling with: How do they convey caution about an accusation while also being supportive of a woman’s claim?\\n\\nA poll out Wednesday by Monmouth University shows that Americans are split on who to believe.\\n\\nBiden is in the process of searching for a vice presidential candidate, who he has promised will be a woman, and some of the potential candidates have focused their comments on how they believe women have the right to be heard while in the next breath defending Biden.\\n\\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle that Reade “has a right to tell her story. And I believe that, and I believe Joe Biden believes that, too.”\\n\\n“I believe women deserve to be heard, and I believe that has happened here,” Stacey Abrams said in a statement to The Post. “The allegations have been heard and looked into, and for too many women, often, that is not the case.”\\n\\n“I think this case has been investigated,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has worked to bring sexual assault cases to light, said on MSNBC. “I know the vice president as a major leader on domestic abuse. I worked with him on that.”\\n\\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who has said she was sexually assaulted in college, told NPR when asked if this allegation concerned her: “Well, I think women should be able to tell their stories. I think that it is important that these allegations are vetted, from the media to beyond.”\\n\\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), one of the first senators to say Franken needed to go, reiterated that she believes women need to be heard in these situations and that she supports Biden. She told The Post: “Vice President Biden has vehemently denied these allegations, and I support Vice President Biden.”\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said Thursday on MSNBC that she is “satisfied” with how Biden has responded.\\n\\nBiden faced growing calls within the party to address the allegation himself, which he did Friday.\\n\\nWhat Trump and his campaign are saying\\n\\nTrump has given statements that range from cast doubting doubt on the accusation, saying that it could be a “false accusation,\" to saying Reade “seems very credible,\" and to trying to accuse Biden of dismissing the allegation: “I mean, his choice of words weren’t very good when he, you know, dismissed the allegation,” he told the New York Post in an interview Monday. \"But he’s got to fight his own battles, and we’ll see how he does.”\\n\\nHis campaign has focused much of its commentary on what they see as a double standard in how Biden is being treated by his supporters and the media as compared to other accused men like Kavanaugh. After Biden’s interview, the campaign issued a statement saying Biden had not sufficiently addressed the allegations, and charging him and his supporters with hypocrisy.\\n\\nThe double standard exhibited by Biden, prominent liberal women’s groups, and Democrat elected officials – some of whom want to be Biden’s running mate – is glaring and cannot be allowed to stand. There will be a great temptation among Biden’s supporters to take his lackluster interview performance and declare ‘case closed’ and move on. We do not know what, if anything, was done to Tara Reade, but there cannot be one set of rules for Joe Biden and another set for everyone else.',\n",
       " 'In court documents filed Thursday, the Justice Department said “after a considered review of all the facts and circumstances of this case, including newly discovered and disclosed information … the government has concluded that [Flynn’s interview by the FBI in January 2017] was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn,” and that it was “conducted without any legitimate investigative basis.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is highly unusual for the Justice Department to seek to undo a guilty plea, and comes just months after Attorney General William P. Barr pressed prosecutors in another of Mueller’s cases to soften their sentencing recommendation for the president’s friend and former political adviser Roger Stone.\\n\\nFlynn was one of the first and highest-ranking Trump aides to cooperate and be convicted in Mueller’s investigation. He pleaded guilty in December 2017 to making false statements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States before Trump had taken office and as the FBI was attempting to ascertain whether anyone in Trump’s campaign had coordinated with Russia to influence the election’s outcome.\\n\\nHowever, his case became one of the most bitterly contested after Mueller’s probe ended in March 2019. Flynn’s new defense lawyers began moving to void his conviction, alleging he was the victim of a partisan conspiracy by prosecutors, federal investigators and even his initial attorneys. His new defense team also alleged he was insufficiently represented by one of Washington’s most prominent law firms, Covington & Burling, when he entered his guilty plea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarr in January directed the U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen of St. Louis to review the case’s handling by the federal prosecutor’s office in Washington, which took over Mueller cases last year, and Jensen made the final recommendation.\\n\\n“Through the course of my review of General Flynn’s case, I concluded the proper and just course was to dismiss the case,” Jensen said in a statement. “I briefed Attorney General Barr on my findings, advised him on these conclusions, and he agreed.”\\n\\nThe retreat could be a political windfall for Trump, who last month announced on Twitter that he was “strongly considering a Full Pardon” for Flynn, whom Trump removed just weeks into the new administration. The Justice Department’s decision also means that the president won’t have to become personally involved in the Flynn case to get the outcome he desired.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump said Thursday that he had been informed of the Justice Department’s decision. “He was an innocent man,” the president said. “Now in my book he’s an even greater warrior.”\\n\\nTrump called former president Barack Obama’s administration “human scum” who committed “treason” by unjustly investigating Trump’s 2016 campaign and his advisers.\\n\\nThursday’s filings suggest a handful of former senior FBI officials are to blame for a meritless pursuit of Flynn. The filing mentions internal communications between former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, former case agent Peter Strzok, and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page — all of whom have faced criticism for other conduct — and argues that those conversations show the FBI investigation of Flynn, dubbed Operation Razor, should not have existed at all.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The frail and shifting justifications for its ongoing probe of Mr. Flynn, as well as the irregular procedure that preceded his interview, suggests that the FBI was eager to interview Mr. Flynn irrespective of any underlying investigation,” the new filing contends.\\n\\nAitan Goelman, a lawyer for Strzok, said the filing “provides yet more evidence of President Trump’s determination to politicize the Department, and Attorney General Barr’s determination to assist the President in doing so.”\\n\\nHe said the FBI had initially decided to end the investigation before learning of Flynn’s phone calls with the Russian ambassador, and before the administration had denied what was said on them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The idea that this was an insufficient basis to continue a counterintelligence investigation whose purpose was to discover whether the Trump Campaign colluded with the Government of Russia — a country which had just attacked the United States to help get Trump elected — is preposterous,” he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This is a sad day for the rule of law in America.”\\n\\nThe move is likely to intensify concerns within and outside the Justice Department that Barr and its politically appointed leadership is intervening in sensitive cases to help the president’s friends and political allies.\\n\\nThe Flynn motion must be reviewed by a judge.\\n\\nFlynn, 61, was a senior Trump campaign foreign policy aide who went on to serve 24 days as national security adviser, the shortest tenure on record. He was fired from the White House in 2017 for misstating the nature of his contacts with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Vice President Pence, senior White House aides, federal investigators and the news media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn his plea, Flynn admitted he was in touch with senior Trump transition officials before and after his communications with Kislyak. The pre-inauguration communications with Kislyak involved efforts to blunt Obama administration policy decisions on sanctions on Russia and a United Nations resolution on Israel, according to his plea. He also admitted misstating his lobbying work for the government of Turkey.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFlynn faced up to a five-year prison term under the charge, but in exchange for his “substantial assistance” to prosecutors investigating the Trump administration, Mueller’s team initially recommended probation as a possible sentence.\\n\\nOnce Mueller’s probe ended, however, Flynn changed defense teams. He began accusing the FBI prosecutors of manufacturing the charges against him, coercing him into admitting he lied and withholding evidence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan rejected those arguments. But in January, Flynn moved to take back his plea. Flynn claimed that he was in fact innocent and that was a victim of ineffective defense counsel as well as unscrupulous prosecutors who demanded his false testimony against his ex-business partner.\\n\\nProsecutors have previously rejected any government misconduct in his case. They argued his allegations had no relevance to the sole charge to which he pleaded guilty, and the main focus of that charge, lying about his Kislyak contacts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe filing came one day before a Justice Department deadline to answer defense allegations of misconduct prompted by the Barr-ordered review, and coincided with the withdrawal from the case of its lead prosecutor, veteran national security prosecutor Brandon L. Van Grack.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn recent days, Flynn had elevated attacks on law enforcement, citing newly unsealed documents turned over by Jensen’s review to the defense showing that the FBI was about to close the investigation into Flynn in early 2017 until new evidence prompted them to keep it open.\\n\\nFlynn also seized on notes turned over in the review showing FBI officials discussed in advance how to handle the January 2017 interview with Flynn about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States before Trump took office.\\n\\nThe notes show that before the Flynn interview, FBI officials discussed the possibility he would lie to them, given that he had already apparently denied to other White House officials that he’d discussed sanctions against Russia weeks earlier in phone calls with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“What is our goal?” the notes said. “Truth/admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?” The note said the FBI should “protect our institution by not playing games.”\\n\\nTrump wrote and retweeted a flurry of messages sympathetic to Flynn last week, saying, “What happened to General Michael Flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!”\\n\\nAt a news conference, asked if he rehire Flynn, Trump said, “I would certainly consider it, yeah, I would,” adding, “I think he’s a fine man.”\\n\\nSeparately Flynn has also claimed his former attorneys were “in the grip of intractable conflicts of interest” and “irreparably tainted” his original plea. Flynn had admitted that he knowingly lied to the Justice Department in foreign lobbying disclosure filings about whether he and his former business partner, Bijan Rafiekian, had acted as agents for the Turkish government. The firm had represented Flynn in filing the Foreign Agent Registration Act forms he is accused of lying about. Flynn’s new defense claims it obscured its own errors while representing Flynn in his criminal case.',\n",
       " 'Trump unveiled the moniker this week — during a trip to a face-mask manufacturing facility in Phoenix on Tuesday and again in an Oval Office photo op with nurses Wednesday — suggesting it is no longer just medical workers on the front lines who must respond against the lethal illness.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I’m actually calling now . . . the nation warriors,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We have to be warriors. We can’t keep our country closed down for years.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president’s use of the term has capped a weeks-long rhetorical effort to frame the crisis through battlefield language. Trump has called himself a “wartime president” and cast the virus as an “invisible enemy” that is “smart” and “tough.” In recent days, he has taken to comparing the national emergency to other moments in American history when the nation’s collective spirit and bravery helped overcome threats from a challenging foe, including World War II.\\n\\nYet in his efforts to rally public support, Trump — as he did with the farmers and GOP lawmakers — is again shifting the burden and potential repercussions of his decisions onto those whom he is enjoining in the fight, in this case most other Americans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s push to loosen state and municipal shutdowns in hopes of bolstering the cratering economy has come as the pandemic’s death toll in the United States neared 73,000 — blowing through the White House’s favored model projection of 60,000 — with few signs of slowing. Most medical experts have warned that restarting the economy too soon could result in new spikes in cases of covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, and corresponding deaths.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Hopefully that won’t be the case . . . but it could very well be the case,” Trump acknowledged.\\n\\nAfter his administration promoted federal social distancing guidelines for 45 days in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, Trump has reiterated his previous warnings that he views the widespread stay-at-home orders and closures of business and schools as a cure that is potentially “worse than the problem itself.” More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March, shattering records, and mental health experts have seen a rise in depression, substance abuse and suicides.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has sought to project confidence that public life can resume, even though while the number of coronavirus cases in the country has plateaued, it has not dropped — and has continued to rise outside New York, an early epicenter of the disease.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis trip to a Honeywell plant producing face masks in Phoenix marked a resumption of presidential travel as the White House moves to demonstrate a return to a more normal public schedule. Trump has tweeted support for relatively small groups of protesters who have called for state and local governments to lift public shutdowns. This week, Trump toyed with disbanding the White House’s coronavirus task force, before announcing it will remain intact with a shift in focus toward safely reopening the country.\\n\\n“My sense is they are moving pretty dramatically away from the concerns of the medical community over the loss of life and they have decided the top priority has to be saving the American economy,” said Peter Wehner, who served as a speechwriter for President George W. Bush. He said he does not recall Bush calling the general public “warriors” during his administration’s “war on terror” after the 9/11 attacks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWehner predicted Trump’s push to reopen would backfire by making the pandemic worse, but he added: “Trump is trying to gear up the public for it. He’s trying to position this as a great struggle against a foreign enemy. But to position the American people as warriors, as if they are engaged in a real war, is the wrong way to view this. Courage and sacrifice and patriotism in this case means social distancing.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has grown impatient with the public shutdowns as the economic shock has upended his campaign message. Once confident that he could win reelection by touting a strong economy, the president and his campaign team are scrambling to adjust to the possibility that the nation, and the globe, could still be mired in recession, or even a depression, come this fall.\\n\\nWhite House aides defended the president’s rhetoric by suggesting he was calling on the public to abide by some social distancing safeguards even as businesses reopen. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that Trump considers the public warriors “because they’ve stayed home . . . because they’ve social-distanced.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen a reporter pointed out that Trump used the language while calling for a return to public life, McEnany replied, “The president says they’re warriors to reopen because, guess what — in order to get to reopening, you have to social distance.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat’s not how Trump put it during his Honeywell visit. While meeting with Native Americans who have been hit hard by the virus, Trump said he views American citizens as “warriors” because “we can’t keep our country closed.” Then he boasted about the low unemployment numbers and record-high stock market before the pandemic arrived.\\n\\n“Now it’s time to open it up. And you know what? The people of our country are warriors, and I’m looking at it,” Trump said. “Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJennifer Mercieca, an associate professor at Texas A&M University who specializes in presidential communications, said Trump’s rhetoric falls short because “it’s empty framing in that he doesn’t tell us what the plan is.”\\n\\nShe pointed to Trump rebuking Sophia Thomas, president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, who said during the Oval Office photo op Wednesday that hospitals were having only “sporadic” success in obtaining enough personal protective equipment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump — who has bristled at criticism that his administration has failed to help deliver enough medical supplies — shot back: “Sporadic for you, but not sporadic for a lot of other people.”\\n\\nAD',\n",

A divided D.C. Circuit found the House was legally engaged in a judicial process that exempts Congress from secrecy rules that typically shield grand jury materials from disclosure.\\n\\nMueller’s report found insufficient evidence to conclude the Trump campaign encouraged Russia’s interference, and neither concluded the president had obstructed justice nor exonerated him. The Justice Department released a redacted version of Mueller’s report, and said it would provide congressional leaders with the full report minus the grand-jury materials. It said Attorney General William P. Barr lacked discretion to release that information.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough Trump was acquitted by the Senate in February, House Democrats have told the D.C.

Circuit in a recent filing.\\n\\nIn its 2-1 opinion, the D.C. Circuit said grand jury records are court records — not Justice Department records — and have historically been released to Congress in the course of impeachment investigations involving three federal judges and two presidents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe House Judiciary Committee’s “need for the grand jury materials remains unchanged. The Committee has repeatedly stated that if the grand jury materials reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses, the Committee may recommend new articles of impeachment,” wrote Judge Judith Rogers, who was joined by Judge Thomas B. Griffith.\\n\\n“Courts must take care not to second-guess the manner in which the House plans to proceed with its impeachment investigation or interfere with the House’s sole power of impeachment,” wrote Rogers.\\n\\nJudge Neomi Rao dissented, saying the House Judiciary Committee lacks legal grounds to ask the court to enforce a subpoena for the grand jury materials.

       " 'Several hours later, we got another example of the White House resisting what those health experts are advising.\\n\\nThe Associated Press reported around midnight that the White House had shelved planned guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The document, which was due nearly a week ago, was aimed at providing local authorities with step-by-step guidance on how to reopen:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled “Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,” was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen. It was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told the guidance “would never see the light of day,” according to a CDC official. The official was not authorized to talk to reporters and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nA coronavirus task force official told The Washington Post that the document has not been completely shelved but was in the process of being revised because it was “overly specific.” The official also indicated that it was felt the document was too broad, as “guidance in rural Tennessee shouldn’t be the same guidance for urban New York City.”\\n\\nThe denial, though, reinforces that the White House is reluctant to submit to the CDC’s more detailed prescriptions for reopening the economy. And it’s difficult to divorce the delay in this document’s publication from Trump’s anxiety to reopen the economy — and the tension that has created with past guidelines.\\n\\nThe administration in mid-April issued phased advice on when areas should start to reopen places such as restaurants and other nonessential businesses. But many states have moved forward with certain elements of reopening without actually satisfying those guidelines. Most notably, they have begun to reopen without meeting the Phase One guideline that they should see a decrease in confirmed coronavirus cases over a 14-day period.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs The Post’s Philip Bump reported, some states that have pushed forward with reopening have also seen an increase in cases — which would prevent them from satisfying the requirement for moving into Phase Two. That requirement is that the decline should continue for another 14 days after Phase One begins.\\n\\nIssuing a detailed document would seemingly complicate further reopenings, because it would again restrict what states and local authorities are supposed to do.\\n\\nThe Washington Post’s Lena H. Sun and Josh Dawsey previewed what the document was set to look like last week. And they also obtained a draft of the document. The new guidelines were to go beyond the initial ones in prescribing specific actions that could be taken in each phase of the reopening. Advocates for reopening have worried that strict guidance could make it difficult for businesses, churches, child-care centers and other facilities to actually function.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, who has long signaled a desire to begin reopening that economy sooner rather than later, has doubled down on that rhetoric in recent days. Despite a steady national death rate that approached previous highs on Tuesday and Wednesday, and even though cases continue to increase outside the major U.S. hotbed of New York City, Trump on Tuesday signaled that we are entering the “next stage” of reopening the economy.\\n\\n“Thanks to the profound commitment of our citizens, we’ve flattened the curve, and countless American lives have been saved,” Trump said. “Our country is now in the next stage of the battle: a very safe phased and gradual reopening. So, reopening of our country — who would have ever thought we were going to be saying that? A reopening. Reopening.”\\n\\nTrump has been resistant to the advice of the health officials around him, from the early days of the outbreak when he continuously downplayed the severity of the situation. On several occasions, this tension has boiled over.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe’re also hearing from those officials less and less. The CDC long ago ceased holding briefings on the coronavirus outbreak, and the White House coronavirus task force briefings, which often featured health experts Anthony S. Fauci and Deborah Birx, have now been halted in favor of less-frequent and less-coronavirus-focused briefings from McEnany. Fauci has also been prevented from testifying to the Democratic-controlled House, although he is still slated to testify in the GOP-controlled Senate and has continued doing some interviews. The cumulative effect is that these health experts aren’t on the record as much as the effort to reopen the economy begins in earnest.',\n",
       " 'with Mariana Alfaro\\n\\nPresident Trump reversed course on Wednesday by announcing that he will not disband the White House coronavirus task force in the coming weeks, caving to criticism that he is trying to move on too quickly from the still-raging contagion, which has killed at least 72,000 and infected more than 1.2 million people in the United States.\\n\\nSpeaking in the Oval Office, Trump nodded to the gravity of the crisis as he sought to pin the blame entirely on China for his administration’s slow early response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. “This is really the worst attack we’ve ever had,” he said. “This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center. There’s never been an attack like this. And it should have never happened. It could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped in China.”\\n\\nAs everyday Americans struggle amid the worst public health and economic crises in nearly a century, this president keeps signaling that his attention has turned elsewhere. His administration moved on Wednesday to advance an agenda that includes stripping health insurance coverage from millions of Americans, pursuing a vendetta against a billionaire who owns an independent newspaper he doesn’t like, granting more protections to students who are accused of sexually assaulting their classmates, vetoing a bipartisan measure designed to prevent a shooting war with Iran and not just building the border wall – but insisting on expensive design choices.\\n\\nHere are five moves that signal the president’s priorities:\\n\\n1) Trump allowed the deadline to pass on Wednesday for changing his administration’s position in a Supreme Court case that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act.\\n\\nThe president told reporters in the Oval Office that he will forge ahead with trying to toss out the entire 2010 law, despite private warnings from some of his top advisers about the political and public health risks of doing so amid the pandemic.\\n\\nQuote of the day\\n\\n“We want to terminate health care under Obamacare,\" said Trump.\\n\\nWhile Trump has said he wants to preserve popular provisions of Obamacare, such as guaranteeing coverage for people with preexisting conditions and letting young adults stay on the plans of their parents, he still has never outlined a plan to accomplish this. Instead, he signed onto a lawsuit that would undermine the entire law – including the provisions he says he wants to protect.\\n\\nAttorney General Bill Barr attended a meeting of senior officials on Monday in which he argued the administration should temper its opposition to Obamacare in court, to allow for leaving some parts of the law intact, Devlin Barrett reports: “Barr and others in the administration have argued that killing Obamacare completely could be politically damaging to Republicans in an election year, particularly when there is a national health crisis. In two previous case, the Supreme Court upheld the law, but if the high court were to strike it down, millions of people could find themselves without affordable health care. The high court plans to hear arguments in the case later this year, and a decision may not come until 2021, well after the November election. The latest ACA suit was organized by Republican attorneys general in Texas and other states.”\\n\\n“The President’s insistence on doubling down on his senseless and cruel argument in court to destroy the ACA and every last one of its benefits and protections is unconscionable, particularly in the middle of a pandemic,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement.\\n\\n2) A top GOP donor and Trump loyalist is being installed atop the Postal Service.\\n\\n“The Postal Service’s board of governors confirmed late Wednesday that Louis DeJoy, a North Carolina businessman who is currently in charge of fundraising for the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, will serve as the new postmaster general,” Josh Dawsey, Lisa Rein and Jacob Bogage scooped. “The action will install a stalwart Trump ally to lead the Postal Service, which he has railed against for years, and probably move him closer than ever before to forcing the service to renegotiate its terms with companies and its own union workforce. Trump’s Treasury Department and the Postal Service are in the midst of a negotiation over a $10 billion line of credit approved as part of coronavirus legislation in March.”\\n\\nTrump said last month that he wants the Postal Service to quadruple fees for delivering packages for customers such as Amazon in exchange for the agency being able to tap the line of credit. Trump has long argued that Amazon doesn’t pay the Postal Service enough, a charge the agency has forcefully rebutted. Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post. Trump has made no secret of his distaste for Bezos, Amazon or this newspaper’s coverage of his administration.\\n\\n“After criticizing the agency for years, Trump has been consolidating his influence lately. Three Republicans and one Democrat sit on the board of governors after the vice chairman, David Williams, a Democrat, resigned last week,” my colleagues report. “The departure came after Williams told confidants he was upset that the Treasury Department was meddling in what has long been an apolitical agency and felt that his fellow board members had capitulated to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s conditions for the $10 billion line of credit … Democrats have urged the Postal Service to hold firm with Treasury over the terms of the loan, betting they could win more money for the agency in another round of legislation and threatening the Trump administration with taking the risk of disrupting mail service. But in recent days, the Postal Service’s board has appeared open to some of the Trump administration’s terms …\\n\\n“DeJoy will be the first postmaster general in two decades who did not rise through the agency’s ranks. … Megan Brennan, the current postmaster general, who announced her retirement late last year, had clashed with the Trump administration over its efforts to take more control over postal finances and operations. Trump had urged her early in his tenure to increase fees for Amazon.” The Postal Service notes that its shipping rates are competitive with other carriers and quadrupling prices for Amazon would only prompt the company to ship through FedEx, UPS or its own delivery service.\\n\\nIn a related power play, the Pentagon’s Office of the Inspector General issued a report last month stating that it found no evidence of undue influence or pressure on Defense Department personnel who handled a cloud computing contract potentially worth $10 billion, which was widely expected to go to Amazon before the company got snubbed. But the White House invoked executive privilege to block senior department officials from answering investigators’ questions about what Trump told them. “Good-government advocates said the White House’s decision to invoke executive privilege to prevent senior officials from speaking to investigators could suggest wrongdoing on the part of the president,” Ellen Nakashima and Aaron Gregg reported.\\n\\nThe White House declined to comment on the latest moves. “The Postal Service is in crisis and needs real leadership and someone with knowledge of the issues,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service. “This crony doesn’t cut it.”\\n\\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos arrives for Trump\\'s coronavirus news conference at the White House on March 27. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\\n\\n3) Education Secretary Betsy DeVos released a 2,033-page regulation that grants new rights to college students accused of sexual assault.\\n\\n“The new rule bars universities from using a single official to investigate and judge complaints, a popular model, and instead creates a judicial-like process in which the accused has the right to a live hearing and to cross-examine accusers,” Laura Meckler reports. “The rule also adds dating violence and stalking to the definition of sexual harassment. But it otherwise offers a narrow definition of harassment, requiring that it be severe and pervasive, as well as objectively offensive. … Overall, the rule narrows the types of complaints that institutions are obligated to investigate. For instance, universities will be required to investigate complaints only if they are made to proper authorities. … But incidents that occur off campus between two students on their own would not be subject to Title IX procedures.”\\n\\nThis new rule, which was first proposed in 2018 after DeVos revoked guidance issued by the Obama administration, has been strongly criticized by universities, women’s rights groups and congressional Democrats. They worry this will let assailants off the hook, discourage victims from coming forward, subject survivors to additional trauma, make college campuses less safe for women and turn campuses into courtrooms.\\n\\n“On Wednesday, a leading advocacy group for colleges said the decision to implement the rule in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic reflected ‘appallingly poor judgment,’” Meckler reports. “‘We will fight this rule in court, and we intend to win,’ Emily Martin, a vice president at the National Women’s Law Center, an advocacy group, said Wednesday. She said the core of the challenge would be that the Education Department was ‘arbitrary and capricious’ and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how agencies write regulations. She said the agency ignored evidence showing that the rule would harm survivors of sexual violence.”\\n\\nPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who has denied an allegation of sexual assault by a former legislative assistant, pledged on Wednesday to overturn the new regulations if he beats Trump in November. “Simply put: this new rule gives colleges a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights,” said Biden.\\n\\n“The Education Department also wanted to finalize the rule in time to avoid having it rolled back by the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn regulations passed in the previous months, GOP officials said. The administration feared that passing it too late might allow Democrats to attempt to undo it if they gain control of Congress next year,” per Meckler. “The rewrite of Title IX regulation will probably be recorded as the most significant and lasting legacy of DeVos’s tenure as education secretary. … She has worked to bolster for-profit colleges, but those moves affect just a slice of higher education. This regulation, by contrast, affects every school that accepts federal money, which is virtually all of them.”\\n\\n4) Trump vetoed a war powers resolution that would limit his authority to launch military strikes against Iran without congressional approval.\\n\\n“The measure, chiefly sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), earned bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and came after Trump ordered a drone strike that killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader in Baghdad. It first passed the Republican-controlled Senate on Feb. 13 on a vote of 55 to 45, and the Democratic-led House passed it, 227 to 186, on March 11,” Seung Min Kim reports. “In a formal statement released by the White House, Trump called the measure a ‘very insulting resolution’ that Democrats introduced as a wedge issue to divide Republicans ahead of the November elections. ‘The few Republicans who voted for it played right into their hands,’ Trump said in the statement. … Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) set up an override vote for 1:30 p.m. Thursday. That vote is almost certain not to meet the two-thirds threshold to successfully overturn a president’s veto.”\\n\\nThis section of Trump’s border wall has been painted black in Calexico, Calif. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\\n\\n5) Trump’s order to paint the border wall black could drive up its cost by $500 million or more.\\n\\nThis is according to government contracting estimates obtained by The Post. “The president’s determination to have the steel bollards coated in black has fluctuated during the past several years, and military commanders and border officials believed as recently as last fall that they had finally talked him out of it. They consider the black paint unnecessary, costly and a significant long-term maintenance burden, and they left it out of the original U.S. Customs and Border Protection design specifications,” Nick Miroff and Dawsey report. “Trump has not let go of the idea, insisting that the dark color will enhance its forbidding appearance and leave the steel too hot to touch during summer months.\\n\\n“During a border wall meeting at the White House last month amid the coronavirus pandemic, the president told senior adviser Jared Kushner and aides to move forward with the paint job and to seek out cost estimates, according to four administration officials with knowledge of the meeting. … Trump, during that meeting, directed aides to seek input from North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel, a company the president favors. Fisher has a $400 million contract to build a section of new barrier in Arizona, an award that is under review by the Department of Defense inspector general. …\\n\\n“The president has promoted the border wall in tweets as well as in private conversations in recent weeks, aides say, amid criticism of the administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He has also touted the structure — along with his efforts to block immigration — as a defense against the virus and a benefit to public health. Trump has made the border wall a pillar of his reelection pitch, promising to finish 500 miles by early next year, a goal that will require crews to nearly double their pace in coming months. Crews have completed about 175 miles of new barriers so far …\\n\\n“During the same White House meeting, Kushner expressed frustration at the pace of land acquisition in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, where the Trump administration is preparing to seize hundreds of parcels of private land from owners who have refused to sell. Trump’s son-in-law, who is also at the center of the administration’s pandemic response, has been placed in charge of overseeing construction. He expressed frustration at this role during the meeting, telling others the wall was not his favorite project but that he is the only one who can get it done.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, a 57-year-old man who became ill while in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement died on Wednesday as a result of a coronavirus infection. “San Diego County health officials confirmed that the man was hospitalized in late April after showing virus-related symptoms at ICE’s Otay Mesa Detention Center, which has the county’s largest outbreak cluster,” Arelis Hernández reports. “More than 132 detainees there have tested positive for the disease caused by the coronavirus … The detainee who died Wednesday was identified by his sister as Carlos Escobedo Mejia. Mejia came to the United States decades ago with his family after war broke out in his home country of El Salvador. ICE agents arrested him in January …\\n\\n“Mejia, who had diabetes, later spent days vomiting and complaining of pain, according to his sister, Rosa Escobedo Mejia. At one point, he stopped eating, according to a recorded interview with his sister that was released by advocates who have been in touch with the family. ‘They lock them up like animals,’ Escobedo Mejia said. ‘Everyone was getting infected.’”\\n\\nMejia was one of 2,655 people who reportedly died in the United States on Wednesday from the coronavirus.\\n\\nWelcome to The Daily 202, PowerPost’s essential briefing for decision makers.\\n\\nMore on the federal response\\n\\nThe Trump administration shelved a CDC plan for reopening the country.\\n\\nA 17-page report “was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen. It was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told the guidance ‘would never see the light of day,’ according to a CDC official,” the AP reports. “The rejected reopening guidance was described by one of the federal officials as a touchstone document that was to be used as a blueprint for other groups inside the CDC who are creating the same type of instructional materials for other facilities. The guidance contained detailed advice for making site-specific decisions related to reopening schools, restaurants, summer camps, churches, day care centers and other institutions.

He was relieved,” Robert Klemko and Griff Witte report. “Less than an hour’s drive east on historic Route 66, in the even smaller city of Grants, the mayor was fighting a very different enemy last week: the governor. Mayor Martin ‘Modey’ Hicks was screaming at state troopers he had derided as ‘Gestapo’ and leading a rebellion against Lujan Grisham’s statewide stay-at-home orders. He was encouraging local businesses on the city’s hard-luck main drag to defiantly reopen. There was no sense shutting down the economy, Hicks said, just because of a virus that, like the flu, needed to be left to ‘take its course.’ The disparate reactions from two mayors within the same region of a single state reflect America’s ever-widening gulf in the struggle against covid-19. … The lightly populated county surrounding Grants, Cibola, has seen just 74 confirmed novel coronavirus cases as of Wednesday.

And like all of them, she produces a special class of disease-fighting antibodies — tiny, even by antibody standards — that show early promise in laboratory tests in blocking the novel coronavirus from entering and infecting cells. In a paper published Tuesday in the journal Cell, an international team of scientists reports that these petite antibodies, harvested from Winter’s blood, were used to engineer a new antibody that binds to the spiky proteins that stud the surface of the novel coronavirus, ‘neutralizing’ its insidious effect.

Rendón, the Venezuelan political strategist tapped by Guaidó to help lead the secretive committee. … But soon after the signing, Rendón said, Goudreau began acting erratically…. The relationship between the two men quickly went south. … [Rendón] and other opposition officials considered the operation dead. Until Sunday morning, [when] Goudreau appeared in a video with a former Venezuelan military officer in battle fatigues. The men proclaimed the start of an operation to ‘liberate’ Venezuela … But by then the mission — apparently infiltrated by Maduro’s agents — had already sustained a devastating blow, with eight men killed and two captured … Goudreau insists that some form of the operation is ‘ongoing’ and that Venezuela’s mainstream opposition betrayed him by reneging on their deal. He said he opted to move forward with what he says he was hired to do. He said it had nothing to do with money; he was doing ‘the right thing.’”\\n\\nMaduro released a video of former U.S. Special Forces soldier Luke Derman, who was captured by Venezuelan forces Monday as he and seven others approached the country’s coastline in a small boat in an attempt to capture Maduro.

       " \"Straightforward, yes, but simple, no. Such a process, scaled to meet the needs of the entire country, would require hundreds of thousands of tests each day. Researchers from Harvard’s Global Health Institute, partnering with NPR, used projections of the spread of the virus to estimate that the United States would need to conduct more than 917,000 tests each day to most effectively detect new outbreaks of the virus — a detection that would then kick off another complicated process of tracing and isolating any contacts with the infected person.\\n\\nThe number of tests needed varies by state, as you might expect. According to the NPR-Harvard analysis, only nine states are currently conducting the number of tests that would be needed to meet the standard the group set for testing. That standard isn’t universal; some researchers expect that the number of daily tests would need to be in the millions, not the hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is at least one employer in the United States that is currently meeting a robust standard of testing aimed at preventing an outbreak: the White House.\\n\\nWe’ve known for some time that the White House was deploying rapid-result tests for the virus, including testing members of the press corps covering the administration. On Wednesday, we learned that this effort extends beyond the White House grounds. During President Trump’s visit to a mask production facility in Arizona this week, he opted not to wear a mask, despite facility policy. A representative for the company he was visiting, Honeywell, explained the reason to The Post’s Greg Sargent.\\n\\n“Following White House recommended protocol, a small number of individuals directly interfacing with the President on Tuesday were tested for COVID-19 immediately prior to the event, received negative test results, and were permitted to not wear masks during portions of the visit based on that medical screening,” the statement read.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is a step beyond simply screening employees for symptoms such as coughing or fevers. This is an effort to create a safe, virus-free bubble around Trump and his team.\\n\\nThis is a good idea, of course. Repeated testing aimed at ensuring a safe work environment is the goal we should seek nationally, and not just when Trump is in the vicinity. But it’s also not the goal that the White House thinks should be set for the rest of the country.\\n\\nPresented with the disconnect between the White House’s testing process aimed at protecting the president and the lack of available testing for employers — something employers themselves told the administration was necessary — White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Wednesday offered an odd response.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Let’s dismiss a myth about tests right now,” McEnany said. “If we tested every single American in this country at this moment, we’d have to retest them an hour later, and then an hour later after that. Because at any moment, you could theoretically contract this virus. So the notion that everyone needs to be tested is just simply nonsensical.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo one is saying that every American needs to be tested every hour, of course. This is a straw man, meant to conflate reasonable calls for more testing with a ridiculous and unattainable alternative. Not everyone in the Honeywell factory needed to be tested, either, but enough tests were done that the White House felt comfortable with Trump participating. That’s one advantage of flying in and flying back out — repeated tests aren’t necessary. But repeated tests of the sort McEnany pooh-poohs are the norm at her office.\\n\\nThe administration’s position on testing has mirrored its rhetoric on ventilators. After getting a slow start, it likes to hype how much it is doing, even as it blames others for failures and gaps.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Wednesday, for example, McEnany compared testing in the United States to testing in South Korea, where the virus has been effectively contained.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“You know, if we want to talk about testing and the volume of testing, the fact that in South Korea there are — we always hear about South Korea and their tests — there are 11 tests per thousand,” she said. “Here in the United States, that’s 17 tests per thousand.”\\n\\nSure ... now. This is a bit like bragging about how effectively you've closed the doors on empty barns. South Korea ramped up testing quickly and effectively contained the virus. We didn't. Our testing ramped up more slowly and only now is reaching the point McEnany praises. What's more, her figure is overall. We're not conducting that many tests per day; we've done so since March.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, true to form, offered some insight earlier in the day on Wednesday into why he is reticent to embrace widespread testing.\\n\\n“The media likes to say we have the most cases, but we do, by far, the most testing,” he said. “If we did very little testing, we wouldn’t have the most cases. So, in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is also true in the same way that a city that never arrests anyone will have a very low number of recorded crimes. It offers a solution if your concern is the metric, but not if your concern is the actual amount of crime that’s occurring. This would not be the first time Trump has indicated that the number of cases is of more concern to him than the affected individuals. In early March, he said he didn’t want to transfer potentially infected passengers off a cruise ship for treatment because he worried it would spike the number of recorded cases in the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the time, he was worried that the number of confirmed cases in the country would jump to 500 or so. As of this writing, there are more than 1.2 million confirmed cases in the United States.\\n\\nAs Trump downplays his interest in testing, he continues to push for the economy to reopen broadly — in other words, getting businesses to relax social distancing without enough testing to detect and trace new infections. The implications for employees is obvious: Many will have to return to work at risk of losing their jobs and, in many cases, they will lack protection from the infection. (A lengthy document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailing measures that should be taken by employers to limit infections was reportedly shelved by the Trump administration.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf you're an employer, this is a potential problem, raising the possibility of workers seeking to hold their employers to account for becoming ill. Hence the push on Capitol Hill for liability protections for businesses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The litigation epidemic has already begun,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday. “As of the end of last week, one report had it that 771 lawsuits had already been filed. This is going to impact our ability to begin to get back to work.”\\n\\nThat’s certainly an interesting choice of words, but an apt one. McConnell and the Trump administration are urging Congress to take steps to prevent the “litigation epidemic” from spreading, implementing the functional equivalent of a vaccine against it. After all, we don’t want to see “body bags of dead businesses and jobs,” as Trump ally Stephen Moore put it in an interview with The Post last week.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis choice between reopening and protecting lives is a false one, of course. Businesses in other countries are reopening with the virus contained and with measures in place to track new infections. The position the United States is in is largely one that is a function of the choices our leaders have made. That includes the choice in one workplace to implement a robust testing policy in defense of one particular employee, President Trump.\\n\\nAD\",\n",

       " \"with Paulina Firozi\\n\\nAn early study from Harvard University linking dirty air to the worst coronavirus outcomes has quickly become a political football in Washington.\\n\\nPresidential candidates, agency regulators, oil lobbyists and members of Congress from both parties are using the preliminary research to advance their own political priorities — well before it has a chance to be peer-reviewed.\\n\\nThe stakes are high because the study’s tentative findings could prove enormously consequential for both the pandemic's impact and the global debate over curbing air pollution. The researchers found that pollution emanating from everything from industrial smokestacks to household chimneys is making the worst pandemic in a century even more deadly.\\n\\nA gas flare from the Shell Chemical LP petroleum refinery in Louisiana. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe research, and the ensuing criticism, highlights how fraught it has become to conduct science during a health crisis.\\n\\nDemocrats and the Harvard researchers have argued that the findings – which showed coronavirus patients living in counties with higher levels of air pollution were more likely to die from the respiratory disease – should help convince the Trump administration to cut down air pollution and stop rolling back environmental regulations.\\n\\nYet Trump officials and industry allies are emphasizing the data about covid-19 is too raw and the Harvard model is too rickety for the government to make drastic changes to its environmental policy.\\n\\n“This is not a model that is ready for prime time,” said Louis Anthony “Tony” Cox, a consultant and member of the Environmental Protection Agency's Science Advisory Board, a group that advises the agency on the science underpinning regulation.\\n\\nYet Paul Billings, a senior vice president at the American Lung Association, says the heat the study is getting is just “part of a larger running attempt [by polluting industries] to discredit” science.\\n\\nIn the middle of the tussle is Francesca Dominici, a biostatistics professor, and her team at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Given the rapid spread of the virus, she said, it only made sense to get out her findings as soon as possible “so then places that were highly contaminated and breathing high pollution levels could be prepared.” The debate in Washington around her work “has been really interesting and kind of puzzling,” Dominici said.\\n\\nCritics of President Trump's environmental policies have championed the study since it went online.\\n\\nBillionaire and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg said the Harvard study was another reason it didn’t make sense for the Trump administration to roll back pollution rules for cars and coal plants with “a highly contagious lung disease raging.”\\n\\n“It doesn’t have to be like this. And we must not accept it,” Bloomberg, who ran for president and has promised to spend millions to make sure Trump is not reelected, wrote in an op-ed this week with former EPA chief Gina McCarthy.\\n\\nFormer New York mayor Michael Bloomberg (D). (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAnd after Trump's EPA last month decided not to set stricter national air quality standards for soot, the pollutant Dominici and her team had studied, a group of 18 Senate Democrats cited the Harvard research in a letter to administrator Andrew Wheeler. They demanded to know: “How will this link between air quality and COVID-19 patient outcomes impact future EPA decision-making?”\\n\\nAnd Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has since reshaped his environmental message around the virus’s disproportionate impact on African Americans, a group long known to have more exposure to polluted air.\\n\\n“Covid is shining a bright light on the structural racism that plagues our laws, our institutions and our culture,” the former vice president told donors at an online fundraiser last month.\\n\\nJust as quickly, Republicans warned against jumping to conclusions that may result in tighter regulations.\\n\\nWheeler cautioned in an interview with The Post last month that it is “premature to put too much weight on a study that hasn't been finalized or peer reviewed yet.”\\n\\nWheeler and his counterparts at the Department of Health and Human Services are under pressure from at least one Republican member of Congress to start a formal federal review of the study.\\n\\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md.). (Reuters/Tom Brenner)\\n\\n“My interest is in ensuring that policymakers are not rushed into ill-considered decisions,” said Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, an anesthesiologist and former military doctor who wrote a letter Friday to the two agencies to examine the study and report their conclusions to Congress.\\n\\nAn EPA representative said it is reviewing the request and reiterated Wheeler’s point. “Drawing conclusions from a study without peer review and with insufficient data is irresponsible and paints a distorted scientific picture,” the agency said in a statement.\\n\\nCritics are already trying to poke holes in the quickly-evolving research.\\n\\nThey're especially concerned about a revision that the Harvard team made toward the end of April, weeks after the study was first introduced. After adding new coronavirus data and making other tweaks to their model, the team found a weaker association between covid-19 deaths and long-term soot exposure than initially thought.\\n\\nInstead of linking an increase in exposure of one microgram per cubic meter to a 15 percent greater likelihood of dying of covid-19, the team said instead it is associated with an 8 percent increase in mortality.\\n\\n“So this, from our perspective, suggests that there is some kind of fragility associated with the overall study results,” said Uni Blake, a public health toxicologist at the American Petroleum Institute, the largest oil and gas lobbying group in Washington, which last week sent a letter to the EPA outlining its concerns with the study.\\n\\nCox, the EPA adviser, takes issue with the study's methodology, saying the Harvard team should have used both better data on population density and a more robust mathematical model that better controlled for potential errors to come to its conclusions.\\n\\n“This is bad science dressed up as policy-relevant science,” said Cox, who has been critical of air quality research used by the EPA under previous administrations to set pollution rules.\\n\\nCox was among several advisers with more conservative views added by Scott Pruitt, Trump's first EPA chief, to the Scientific Advisory Board.\\n\\nThe criticism of the Harvard study comes as the agency has convened that board to provide “rapid advice” on the science of covid-19. The group held its first meeting Thursday and will conduct a public teleconference call on May 20.\\n\\nThe Harvard team has defended its work despite the criticism.\\n\\nDominici acknowledged that her study has limitations and that more research using other data, including individuals' health histories, is needed. But she said it is normal to update preliminary results, especially on an evolving threat, and that they are still statistically significant even after the revisions.\\n\\n“It is my responsibility as a public health profession to communicate the science as the science evolves,” she said.\\n\\nAnd she agreed that pollution regulation should be set based on more than a single piece of research. “Our study is one study,” she said. “I don't think that major policy decisions should be made based on our study.”\\n\\nBut she noted other research teams around the world are coming to similar conclusions about the threat dirty air poses during the pandemic. And when it comes to soot pollution specifically, she added, there is already robust evidence that fine particles can embed in the body and trigger asthma, heart attacks and other illnesses.\\n\\n“Big policy regulation should be guided by consensus evidence,” Dominici said, “and the consensus evidence is out there in terms of how harmful” soot is.\\n\\nWelcome to The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.\\n\\nCoronavirus fallout\\n\\nThis California city was ready to pass an ambitious energy policy before a protest threat.\\n\\nSan Luis Obispo was set to pass an ambitious climate change plan that would urge the development of all electric buildings that don’t use fossil fuels.

       " 'The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump was advised twice in January to press China to be more transparent about the outbreak in Wuhan. But Trump ignored the advice:\\n\\nEarly this year, several of Mr. Trump’s political advisers inside and outside the campaign urged him to take on China more directly, which they argued would have bipartisan appeal. One idea they suggested was a special commission to investigate the origins of the virus and whether Beijing responded sufficiently to control the outbreak. Mr. Trump twice declined suggestions from his team in January to press [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] for more transparency about the virus’s causes and symptoms, in one case saying that the criticism could cause Beijing to be less helpful, said White House officials.\\n\\nIn fact, Trump didn’t just decline the suggestions; he actually went in the opposite direction. Trump repeatedly praised China’s coronavirus response through late February. And on two different occasions, he actually vouched for China’s transparency, despite the advice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump did so voluntarily on Jan. 24, tweeting, “The United States greatly appreciates [China’s] efforts and transparency.” He was then asked directly on Feb. 7 whether he was “concerned that China is covering up the full extent of coronavirus.” He said flatly, “No. … They’re working really hard, and I think they are doing a very professional job.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe idea that Trump’s advisers were concerned about China’s lack of transparency around this time — even as Trump was vouching for it — isn’t totally new. The Washington Post’s Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey reported Feb. 16 that Trump’s comments praising China were making administration officials uncomfortable. Among them were Joseph Grogan, head of the White House Domestic Policy Council, who said China could not be trusted, and Peter Navarro, Trump’s China-hawk trade adviser. Chief White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow even publicly contradicted Trump on Feb. 13, saying, “We are a little disappointed that we haven’t been invited in [to China], and we’re a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese.”\\n\\nThe efforts of those around Trump to get him to be tougher on China have gradually paid some dividends, with Trump intermittently adopting a harsher tone — although often still not going as far as some of his allies have. Trump momentarily labeled it the “Chinese virus,” before abandoning that rhetoric in the face of criticism. He has regularly offered broad comments about how we know where the virus began and about how it could have been stopped earlier, although he often avoids invoking China directly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne entity Trump has been willing to go after more strongly is the World Health Organization, which Trump has accused of being too friendly toward China. He has said the United States will withhold funding from the U.N. health agency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Trump’s and his allies’ chief criticism of the WHO — that it has been too friendly toward China — is one that could just as well be lodged at Trump himself early in the crisis. If the argument is that the WHO was too soft on China at the start, when it mattered most, what about Trump? If precious time was lost because the WHO was lending undue credibility to China’s statements and data about the virus and was not taking the situation seriously enough, what to make of a U.S. president who was in many ways echoing the line that China was on top of the situation — in direct contrast to his advisers?\\n\\nTrump allies will argue that there was a difference. Trump, after all, is engaged in a delicate diplomatic dance involving a trade war — a trade war in which a phase-one agreement was signed in mid-January, even as the coronavirus was spreading in Wuhan. Trump may not have just feared that his criticism would hurt Chinese cooperation on the virus but also on further trade agreements. Even throughout the trade war, Trump has repeatedly made a point to lavish praise on Xi and to say that China’s success in taking advantage of the United States is not something to be derided, but rather that our focus should be on American leaders’ incompetence in the face of that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut to some degree, this is a zero-sum game. The argument from Trump and (mostly) from his allies is that this alleged Chinese malfeasance needed to be called out early in the outbreak to prevent the spread of a deadly disease. Yet we’re increasingly learning it was something that was brought to Trump’s attention and that he was urged to do something about. He disregarded it. And what better message to send than a U.S. president saying that China was up to no good?\\n\\nAD',\n",

Thanks for waking up with us.\\n\\nDeath toll: As of this morning, a total of 73,243 U.S. deaths due to covid-19 and at least 1,222,000 cases have been reported since Feb. 29, per The Post\\'s tracker.\\n\\nResidents wait outside a market in East Hollywood, Calif., last month. (Eugene Garcia/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\\n\\nThe People\\n\\nTHE RACE GAP: Communities of color are already bearing the brunt of covid-19, as African Americans and Latinos are getting sick and dying of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus at higher rates.\\n\\nA new Washington Post/Ipsos finds those disparities extend to job losses as well — Hispanics are nearly twice as likely as whites to have lost their jobs amid shutdowns across the country. Blacks are also more likely to have been laid off. And racial disparities in income and wealth will likely worsen as a result of the economic downturn.\\n\\n“The poll finds that 20 percent of Hispanic adults and 16 percent of blacks report being laid off or furloughed since the outbreak began in the United States, compared with 11 percent of whites and 12 percent of workers of other races,” our colleagues Tracy Jan and Scott Clement report.\\n\\nEven more bad news may be coming. Tomorrow, the Labor Department will release the first jobs report tcovering an entire month of shutdowns. If the unemployment rate rises to 16 percent on Friday and historic ratios hold, the gaps for communities of color will be enormous, Heidi Shierholz, policy director at the Economic Policy Institute and the chief economist to the labor secretary during the Obama administration told our colleagues.\\n\\nJust how bad it will get: “ … t he black unemployment rate , which is typically double that of whites, can be expected to reach nearly 30 percent , Shierholz said; the Hispanic unemployment rate can be expected to hit 20 percent ,” per Tracy and Scott.\\n\\n… t , which is typically double that of whites, , Shierholz said; the can be expected to hit ,” per Tracy and Scott. “All recessions exacerbate existing inequalities by race and ethnicity — and always hit black and Hispanic workers harder — but this one will be worse,” Shierholz said. “It will be an absolute nightmare.”\\n\\nThe polling comes as we\\'re learning even more about the disproportionate hit African Americans are taking from the virus: “Black people make up a disproportionate share of the population in 22 percent of U.S. counties, and those localities account for more than half of coronavirus cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths, a national study by an AIDS research group found,” our colleague Vanessa Williams reports.\\n\\nBig development: The study found socioeconomic factors were better predictors than health.\\n\\nEmployment status and access to health care were better predictors of infection and death rates than underlying health conditions.\\n\\nWhy this is happening: “Black and Hispanic workers are bearing the brunt of the economic crisis because they are overrepresented in industries that were hit first by social distancing mandates and stay-at-home orders, economists say,” Tracy and Scott report. “These include leisure and hospitality, such as hotels and restaurants; retail; and construction, where Latino men make up more than a quarter of workers.”\\n\\nKey: “We still have a lot of occupational segregation in this country,” Heidi Shierholz, chief economist to the secretary of labor during the Obama administration and an expert on wage inequality and unemployment, told our colleagues. “Some of it is due to differences in educational attainment. Some of it is due to discrimination and people’s access to networks.”\\n\\n“Age and education also factor into the layoffs,” our colleagues write: “The Post-Ipsos poll finds younger and blue-collar workers, as well as those without college degrees, are most likely to have lost their jobs.”\\n\\nDisparities extend beyond job losses: “Among those who have been laid off, Hispanics are most likely to say the pandemic has been ‘a serious source of stress’ and are twice as likely as whites to say their families will face ‘real financial trouble’ in a month or less if nothing changes,” our colleagues write.\\n\\n“But they are also the least likely group to have applied for or received unemployment benefits since March 1 or to have received a federal relief check.”\\n\\nMISPLACED OPTIMISM: Laid off and furloughed workers are optimistic they will return to their old jobs, the Washington Post-Ipsos poll released this morning finds.\\n\\n“ Nearly 6 in 10 say it is ‘very likely’ they will get their old job back, according to the poll,” Heather Long and Emily Guskin report.\\n\\nHeather Long and Emily Guskin report. \"Going back to a prior job is typically much easier — and faster — than searching for an entirely new job,” per Heather and Emily. “It also gives laid-off workers a greater sense of comfort about their finances. Studies show that workers who believe they are only a few weeks away from a steady job again are less likely to spiral into a depression or stop paying major bills.”\\n\\nBut economists fear people might be too optimistic: “The longer people are out of work, the less likely they are to be called back,” our colleagues write. “In an alarming trend, companies like General Electric and Nordstrom initially announced they were furloughing employees, a temporary layoff where workers aren’t paid but usually keep their health insurance. But now some of those furloughs are becoming permanent layoffs.\"\\n\\nThe largest unknown is how reopening goes: “Economists say the best chance for any sort of recovery is to get as many workers as possible back into their old jobs.”\\n\\n“Economists say the best chance for any sort of recovery is to get as many workers as possible back into their old jobs.” “A new report from the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago predicts 42 percent of the recent layoffs from the pandemic will result in permanent job losses. There are two big issues: First, many companies are going bankrupt or shutting down permanently, so they won’t need workers. Second, even after parts of the economy reopen, many people will be hesitant to shop, travel and go out to eat as they did before. Businesses operating at half capacity or switching to online or takeout don’t need nearly as many workers,” per Heather and Emily.\\n\\nAnother snag: Some of these jobless workers are having trouble accessing federal relief provided to them by the coronavirus stimulus package.\\n\\n61 percent of laid off workers say they have received a $1,200 or more relief check from the federal government. But 38 percent have not.\\n\\nThere are even more issues with unemployment insurance: “ Half of the laid-off workers say they have been able to apply for unemployment, but under 3 in 10 have received money so far, The Post-Ipsos poll finds. Of those who tried to apply but were unsuccessful, 4 in 10 report that they could not complete the application because phone lines were so busy that they could not get through or their state’s unemployment website wasn’t working,” Heather and Emily report.\\n\\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

But then things unraveled: “Soon after the signing, Rendón said, Goudreau began acting erratically.

But by then the mission — apparently infiltrated by Maduro’s agents — had already sustained a devastating blow, with eight men killed and two captured.”\\n\\nTrump and other U.S. officials have denied any knowledge: “Goudreau says he unsuccessfully sought U.S. backing through an aide in the office of Vice President Pence. He declined to name the aide,” our colleagues write. “A spokeswoman for Pence said Wednesday that there was ‘zero contact’ between anyone in the vice president’s office and Goudreau.”\\n\\nGuaidó denied any existing contract with Goudreau: “Goudreau counters that the agreement — supplied in part to The Post by Goudreau, with a more complete version provided by Rendón — bound the opposition to his services and initial fee. A seven-page document provided by Goudreau carries Guaido’s signature, along with those of Rendón and fellow opposition official Sergio Vergara … Rendón, however, insists that the document Goudreau produced was never signed by Guaidó, and provided previous and subsequent agreements to The Post that did not bear Guaido’s name.\"\\n\\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos.

Flynn also said he did not recall Kislyak calling back two days later to tell him that Russia had abided by Flynn’s request.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFlynn also made false statements to the FBI about his lobbying work for Turkey and about another contact with the Russian ambassador over Dec. 22 and Dec. 23, 2016, pertaining to a U.N. Security Council Resolution on Israeli settlements, according to his guilty plea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat did Trump and Flynn say at the time?\\n\\nTrump tweeted Dec. 2, 2017: “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”\\n\\nFlynn agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation, and Mueller later recommended no jail time for Flynn due to his “substantial” assistance. Flynn sat for at least 19 interviews and gave evidence of Trump’s potential obstruction of justice and about WikiLeaks. He pleaded guilty to a single count of false statements, though prosecutors indicated that they could have charged him with more offenses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn pleading guilty, Flynn said: “I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel’s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”\\n\\nProsecutors said FBI agents gave Flynn multiple opportunities to correct his false statements during the interview. Flynn testified in 2018 that he knew it was a crime when he lied to the FBI.\\n\\nIn seeking to void his guilty plea, Flynn now argues that he was entrapped by the FBI and given ineffective counsel by his former attorneys at the firm Covington & Burling.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has said he’s “strongly considering” a pardon for Flynn.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat are the new documents?\\n\\nIn January, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered a review of Flynn’s prosecution and assigned it to Jeffrey B. Jensen, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Jensen on April 24 sent a cache of documents to Flynn’s new attorneys, which were later made public.\\n\\nA Jan. 24 email from [former FBI agent Peter] Strzok to recipients including the FBI general counsel at the time appears to prepare an official identified as “DD” — an abbreviation Strzok often used to refer to former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe — for calling Flynn to arrange the interview and answering questions Flynn might have. Strzok suggests that McCabe be ready if Flynn asked if he were under criminal investigation or began volunteering information, and to consider having an agent present in that event. In a brief email the evening before, [former FBI lawyer Lisa] Page asked Strzok and others to clarify whether FBI policy required agents to inform Flynn that lying to investigators was a crime before they began, or after they believed he made a false statement. A final disclosure includes one page of handwritten notes, dated Jan. 24, that appear to be the writer’s talking points for an internal FBI meeting, advocating that if Flynn lies in the interview, agents should confront him with a redacted piece of evidence so that he will come clean. “I don’t see how getting someone to admit their wrongdoing is going easy on him,” the notes say, adding, “If we’re seen as playing games, WH will be furious.” It is not clear what evidence the writer was referring to. In the interview, the FBI did not show Flynn a transcript of his conversations with Kislyak. Flynn told investigators he assumed they knew what was said on the call. The Justice Department is expected to formally respond to the allegations by May 11, and has not so far retreated from Flynn’s prosecution. Investigators commonly prepare for interviews, including how to handle situations in which the targets lie.\\n\\n(The “writer” being referenced is E.W. Priestap, the FBI’s former assistant director of counterintelligence.)\\n\\n“To succeed here, the defense will have to prove not merely that the FBI anticipated that Flynn might lie during the interview, but that the FBI encouraged him to lie and induced him to commit a crime that he otherwise would not have committed,” Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, previously told The Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat do the prosecutors and judge say?\\n\\nIn a 92-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan rejected Flynn’s claims “that the FBI conducted an ambush interview for the purpose of trapping him into making false statements and that the government pressured him to enter a guilty plea.” The ruling came in December, before the latest disclosures.\\n\\n“The sworn statements of Mr. Flynn and his former counsel belie his new claims of innocence and his new assertions that he was pressured into pleading guilty to making materially false statements to the FBI,” Sullivan wrote. “And it is undisputed that Mr. Flynn not only made those false statements to the FBI agents, but he also made the same false statements to the Vice President and senior White House officials, who, in turn, repeated Mr. Flynn’s false statements to the American people on national television.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Justice Department says Flynn and his new lawyers are spreading conspiracy theories in an effort to get him off the hook, “all this despite the fact that the defendant has twice admitted his guilt, before two federal judges.”\\n\\n“For example, the defendant and his counsel allege that the Special Counsel’s Office manipulated or controlled the press,” prosecutors wrote in an October 2019 filing. “The claim is divorced from facts and reality.”\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter',\n",
       " 'The action will install a stalwart Trump ally to lead the Postal Service, which he has railed against for years, and probably move him closer than ever before to forcing the service to renegotiate its terms with companies and its own union workforce. Trump’s Treasury Department and the Postal Service are in the midst of a negotiation over a $10 billion line of credit approved as part of coronavirus legislation in March.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe confirmation came after The Washington Post asked for comment on the decision.\\n\\nTrump has indicated he wants the Postal Service to dramatically raise fees for delivering packages for customers such as Amazon in exchange for tapping the line of credit. Trump has long argued that Amazon doesn’t pay the Postal Service enough, a charge the agency has fiercely contested. (Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Post.)\\n\\n“Louis DeJoy understands the critical public service role of the United States Postal Service, and the urgent need to strengthen it for future generations,” Robert M. Duncan, chairman of the board of governors, said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Postal workers are the heart and soul of this institution, and I will be honored to work alongside them and their unions,” DeJoy, who will start June 15, said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House declined to comment.\\n\\nRep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the Postal Service, denounced the move as a reward by Trump to a “partisan donor.”\\n\\n“The Postal Service is in crisis and needs real leadership and someone with knowledge of the issues,” Connolly said. “This crony doesn’t cut it.”\\n\\nAfter criticizing the agency for years, Trump has been consolidating his influence lately. Three Republicans and one Democrat sit on the board of governors after the vice chairman, David Williams, a Democrat, resigned last week.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe departure came after Williams told confidants he was upset that the Treasury Department was meddling in what has long been an apolitical agency and felt that his fellow board members had capitulated to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s conditions for the $10 billion line of credit, according to four people familiar with Williams’s thinking.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWilliams did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nDemocrats have urged the Postal Service to hold firm with Treasury over the terms of the loan, betting they could win more money for the agency in another round of legislation and threatening the Trump administration with taking the risk of disrupting mail service.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in recent days, the Postal Service’s board has appeared open to some of the Trump administration’s terms, according to the four people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations. The precise terms could not be learned.\\n\\n“[Williams’s] main frustration is that he felt the Treasury Department was interfering in an apolitical board and an apolitical agency,” said one person who spoke with him.\\n\\nA Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment.\\n\\nDeJoy will be the first postmaster general in two decades who did not rise through the agency’s ranks. He would have to navigate a financially fraught agency while also working with its powerful labor unions, among the last \\xadpublic-sector unions left with significant clout in contract negotiations with the government.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn part because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Postal Service is projecting a $13 billion revenue shortfall by the end of the fiscal year in September.\\n\\nTrump has for years seized on the rates the Postal Service charges companies like Amazon to deliver packages. The business of package delivery has proved increasingly vital to the service’s finances as first class mail has deteriorated, and Trump has contended the agency charges Amazon and other companies too little.\\n\\nThe Postal Service has rejected those accusations, arguing it is charging competitive rates in an environment where it squares off against UPS, FedEx and even Amazon’s growing delivery service.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMegan Brennan, the current postmaster general, who announced her retirement late last year, had clashed with the Trump administration over its efforts to take more control over postal finances and operations. Trump had urged her early in his tenure to increase fees for Amazon and other companies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe announcement of Brennan’s successor comes at a tumultuous period for the Postal Service, whose already shaky financial footing has grown weaker during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nTrump, responding to a report in The Post in April, threatened to block the $10 billion Postal Service loan unless officials dramatically raised shipping prices on online retailers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The Postal Service is a joke,” Trump said publicly last month in the Oval Office. He called for the agency to quadruple its shipping prices. Many analysts warn that if the Postal Service did that, it would put itself at a massive disadvantage in the marketplace.\\n\\nDeJoy, a North Carolina native, has played a prominent role in Republican politics, particularly since Trump won the presidency in 2016. He has given more than $2 million to the Trump campaign or Republican causes since 2016, according to the Federal Election Commission, including a $210,600 contribution to the Trump Victory Fund on Feb. 19. He has given more than $650,000 to the Trump Victory Fund and more than $1 million to the RNC.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDeJoy was tapped as the finance chairman for the RNC convention in August and has worked in recent months with Katie Walsh, a top Republican operative, to orchestrate the event.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAn RNC spokesman declined to comment.\\n\\nDeJoy’s wife, Aldona Wos, is vice chairman of the president’s Commission on White House Fellowships and is Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Canada. She previously served as ambassador to Estonia in the George W. Bush administration.\\n\\nDeJoy has donated more than $157,000 to Republican candidates, committees and super PACs since the start of the year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\\n\\nDuncan, the current chairman of the Postal Service’s board of governors, served as RNC chairman from 2007 to 2009. He was confirmed in 2018 after being appointed by Trump.\\n\\nDeJoy is the owner of a real estate and consulting firm in North Carolina after having served as chairman and CEO of New Breed Logistics, according to his family’s foundation page. New Breed was sold to XPO Logistics. He is a longtime donor to Republican causes, according to FEC records.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus relief passed in March, the Treasury Department was authorized to lend $10 billion to the Postal Service, which says it may not be able to make payroll and continue mail service uninterrupted past September.\\n\\nMnuchin rejected a bipartisan Senate proposal to give the Postal Service a bailout amid the negotiations over that legislation.\\n\\nBrennan, with the consent of the board of governors, went to Congress to ask for a direct bailout of more than $89 billion to stave off pandemic losses and other long-running accumulated debts.\\n\\nTop Treasury officials were furious at the request, according to a person with knowledge of their frustration.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has rapidly exacerbated years of revenue losses for the agency as it struggles to adapt to a digital age amid a decline in first-class mail.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPostal officials have said mail volume is down by a third during the pandemic and continuing to decrease as businesses scale back solicitations and advertisements. Package volume is up, but not enough to cover the other losses, the officials say.',\n",
       " 'Seven months later, Democrats are at risk of losing the seat.\\n\\nA special election on May 12 will determine whether Democratic state Assemblywoman Christy Smith or Republican businessman Mike Garcia finishes Hill’s term this year. In November, voters will be asked to choose between the same two candidates to represent the district for a two-year term, a contest for which Democrats say they have a better shot at winning.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe inland district encompassing the exurbs of Los Angeles County is one of 39 seats Democrats flipped in 2018, giving them the House majority. To underscore the special election’s importance, both President Trump and Hillary Clinton have weighed in on the race on Twitter, and former president Barack Obama endorsed Smith on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe election presents Republicans with a chance to claw back the red-turned-blue suburban seats they lost in 2018, districts crucial to any hope of the GOP reclaiming the House majority in November. The race also gives Republicans an opportunity to reverse their fortunes in heavily Democratic California, where the GOP holds just six of 53 House seats.\\n\\nFurther complicating the election is the novel coronavirus outbreak. There’s no playbook to predict how voters will act in the midst of a global pandemic. Candidates are relying on virtual meetups to introduce themselves to constituents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBecause of stay-at-home orders, only a limited number of polling places will be open on Election Day, so voters must return mail-in ballots. The state tried to ease the burden by mailing every voter a pre-stamped ballot they simply need to fill out and send back.\\n\\n“We’re trying to run a campaign at the height of the crisis when it is hard to get people’s attention because people are so distracted by the crisis,” Smith said in a recent interview. “We’re hopeful for the best and that the turnout breaks in our favor.”\\n\\nAlmost 1 in 4 voters has cast ballots, a turnout that is “pretty enormous” for a special election, said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc., a California-based bipartisan voter data company that tracks ballot returns.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It simply could be that people are sitting at home and bored. Voting is a little easier when you’re not having to deal with those regular life issues,” Mitchell said. “We’re in this environment that the most exciting thing to do every day is check the mail.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe ballots returned so far seem to favor Garcia. As of this week, 32 percent of registered Republicans, 20 percent of registered Democrats and 15 percent of registered independents had voted, according to Mitchell’s data.\\n\\nDemocrats are setting expectations low for the special election, citing the historically low turnout by their voters in these one-off contests, and setting their sights on November when the presidency will be decided.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“May is going to be harder than November will be,” said a national Democrat with knowledge of the race who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. “We think the candidate is going to get better and it’s going to be a much better election, but we are realistic about what May is going to look like.”\\n\\nSmith is pitching herself as a moderate Democrat with deep roots in the district and a history of public service after nine years on a local school board and a term in the state legislature, someone who will fight for a “robust social safety net.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGarcia says he’s a fiscally conservative D.C. outsider who, as a former Navy pilot, has traveled the world and now wants to serve in Congress “to cut taxes, grow jobs, and keep Sacramento policies from spreading to DC.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGarcia’s campaign declined several requests for an interview with the candidate.\\n\\nThe latest trouble for Democrats occurred last week when a leaked video of a Smith virtual town hall showed her mocking her opponent’s focus on his military résumé. It was a misstep in a district that includes Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works in Palmdale that designed the U-2 spy plane and the F-35; other major defense contractors; and military bases.\\n\\nSmith apologized. “Without question I have the deepest respect for Mike Garcia’s service to our country and I’m sorry for comments that I made that might suggest otherwise,” she said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the National Republican Congressional Committee called it “disgusting,” and Trump weighed in, writing on Twitter: “Vote @MikeGarcia2020 by May 12th! His opponent @ChristyforCA25 . . . Now she’s mocking our Great Vets! We need Navy Fighter Pilot Mike Garcia in #CA25!”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSmith hit back in a series of replies to the president’s tweet: “Now that you’re paying attention to #CA25 Mr. President, a few questions: Where are the tests? Where’s the supply chain help? Why aren’t you taking any responsibility? Where’s $ support for nursing homes and hospitals? Why aren’t you talking about protecting farm workers?”\\n\\nThe Democrats intend to emphasize Garcia’s embrace of Trump, especially as it pertains to the president’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. In another tweet in response to the president, Smith referred to her opponent as a “mini version of Trump.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“In a hyperpartisan presidential election year, Christy Smith being identified as a Democrat is going to be enough for a lot of people,” said Rose Kapolczynski, a Democratic consultant who ran former senator Barbara Boxer’s campaigns. But, she added, “Mike Garcia has the dream profile for the current Republican Party leadership. For decades, they’ve been trying to recruit veterans, small-business people who had the personal talents to be effective campaigners.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGarcia is also a Latino with immigrant parents at a time when Republicans are desperate to blunt Democrats’ advantage in minority communities, especially in a district that is 38 percent Latino.\\n\\nThe state holds a top-two primary — all candidates regardless of party are on the same ballot. If no one breaks 50 percent, the top two vote-getters face off. In that race on March 3, Smith won 36 percent to Garcia’s 25 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe district, which stretches from the rural farmlands in Lancaster to the populous city of Santa Clarita, was held by a Republican for 26 years. For almost all of that time, it was Buck McKeon who would ascend to chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He won his last election in 2012 with 60 percent of the vote. After he retired, Steve Knight won the next two elections until Hill unseated him in 2018, beating him by eight percentage points.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGarry South, a longtime Democratic strategist in California, says the district had been trending blue before Hill’s decisive victory. Clinton beat Trump by seven points in 2016. The Democrats have a voter registration advantage. And, like other areas surrounding major metropolises, its demographics have shifted. It’s a minority-majority district, meaning there are more minority residents than whites.\\n\\n“There’s no metric you can come up with other than Republican wishful thinking to suggest this is somehow a Republican seat or a Republican-leaning seat, or that Mike Garcia has an advantage over Christy Smith,” South said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut, said Kapolczynski, in “a special election, the normal partisan dynamics don’t apply. Typically, turnout is very low, and that means the electorate is older, whiter and more conservative in California.”\\n\\nSmith’s challenge, she said, will be convincing “occasional voters” to turn in their ballots even though it’s the only race to vote on. If those voters participate in primaries, it’s in a presidential year, and they already did that on March 3.\\n\\nNational Democrats had hoped Smith would win outright in March and avoid a situation where they’d potentially lose the seat for the remainder of the year and have to go into November running against the incumbent.\\n\\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has spent $1.7 million on the race, says on its website of Smith: “Christy still has considerable room to grow with women and Latinos.”\\n\\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee has spent $1.2 million, and outside groups have weighed in, with $1.7 million attacking Smith and $502,000 in opposition to Garcia.\\n\\nRob Stutzman, a California GOP consultant, said he didn’t believe a Garcia win in May would be indicative of what will happen in November, but he acknowledged that as a congressman, Garcia would have the advantage of immediately doing constituent work when people are looking to government for help.\\n\\nSmith, as a state assemblywoman, has tried to focus on that work, with her campaign staff trying to connect voters to her office if they need services.',\n",
       " 'A day earlier, Trump had said the administration would probably “have a different group” convened for that purpose, and Vice President Pence confirmed a report that officials were discussing winding down the task force’s work within a month.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe evolving messages reflect a persistent tension within the administration — and the country — over when it will be safe to put the pandemic in the rearview mirror and end the government-imposed restrictions that have slowed the virus’s spread but crippled the nation’s economy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPrivately and publicly, Trump has pushed to reopen the country, though the decision to do so lies more with the governors who have ordered businesses closed in their states. But each time the president or state leaders take a step toward reopening, they are confronted with the reality that the pandemic is far from over and expert warnings that resuming regular activity too soon would exacerbate the destruction unleashed by the coronavirus. Some of the moves by governors also run contrary to White House guidelines for when to begin reopening.\\n\\nPolling shows most Americans, too, are wary of returning to normal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I thought we could wind it down sooner, but I had no idea how popular the task force is until actually yesterday when I started talking about winding down,” Trump said Wednesday, after signing a proclamation in the Oval Office honoring nurses. “It is appreciated by the public.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later said the task force had “gotten our country through this,” and Trump had decided it was “here to stay.”\\n\\nThe group, which includes medical experts Anthony S. Fauci and Deborah Birx, rose to prominence in part because Trump touted its work at daily press briefings. Polling shows Americans overwhelmingly approve of the way federal public health scientists, including Fauci, have dealt with the coronavirus crisis.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe task force has met less frequently in recent days, and the press briefings have stopped. Trump has said he expects those will resume, albeit less frequently. On Twitter, he said the task force would now be “very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics.”\\n\\nDespite signs of progress, the country remains very much in the throes of the crisis. The United States reported more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases and more than 1,800 new deaths Wednesday. The total killed in the United States now stands at more than 73,000 and the total infected at more than 1.2 million.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNew York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), whose state has been the hardest hit but has apparently slowed the virus’s spread, said Wednesday he was confounded to still be seeing hundreds of new infections each day, even as New York residents have been ordered to stay home except for essential trips. He said he recently asked hospitals what sort of people were now falling ill and was told the majority were older than 51 and had been at home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Where are those new cases still coming from?” Cuomo asked. “Because we’ve done everything we can to close down.”\\n\\nCuomo is not alone in struggling to get a handle on the scope and spread of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. Medical experts as well as political leaders have been buffeted by dramatically shifting estimates of its impact.\\n\\nIn late February, Trump predicted the number of coronavirus cases “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” Earlier this week, he said as many as 100,000 could die of the disease. One government model the White House relies on was recently adjusted to project a total even higher — 134,000 — after predicting 60,000 deaths last month.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe grim new projections, though, have not dampened the administration’s optimism for a quick bounce-back.\\n\\nIn an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Pence talked about the importance of “being able to enjoy the outdoors in the sunlight” and expressed hope that “we could be in a very different place by shortly after Memorial Day or early June.”\\n\\nHe also revealed that White House officials had asked college athletic representatives to consider curtailing the attendance of elderly alumni at sporting events as a strategy to reduce the spread of the coronavirus among that higher-risk group.\\n\\nOn Friday, Pence is planning to visit Iowa to discuss reopening religious services and maintaining the nation’s food supply. On Tuesday, Trump visited a face mask manufacturing facility in Arizona, a trip he used to tout his desire to see an easing of the stay-at-home restrictions that have throttled the economy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAccording to his office, Pence is scheduled to meet with faith leaders in Des Moines to discuss safely lifting restrictions on services at houses of worship. He also plans to visit the headquarters of Hy-Vee, the grocery chain that announced this week it would impose limits on meat sales due to worker shortages at meatpacking plants.\\n\\nLast week, Trump signed an executive order compelling meat processors to remain open to address anticipated shortages in the nation’s food supply chain, despite mounting reports of plant worker deaths due to covid-19.\\n\\nSeveral governors this week took steps to end restrictions on their residents, even as public health experts warn that doing so prematurely could be dangerous. But life has hardly returned to normal in those places, in part because Americans are anxious about a return to normalcy and because businesses are often operating under new rules.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Arkansas, for example, where gyms opened this week, those working out were made to wear face coverings and stand 12 feet apart, creating scenes, captured by an Arkansas Times photographer, that were far from usual. In Colorado, salons have reopened but with a fraction of their normal customers, according to Denver’s 9News.\\n\\nGeorgia has permitted malls to open, but not all stores have done so and the crowds at some were thin, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. More people seem to be packing parks on account of the warm weather, Atlanta’s WSB-TV reported.\\n\\nThe nation’s tentative reopening is being driven by a halting dance between government, consumers and businesses, all taking partial steps and fumbling for a balance between activity and safety.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe clothing retailer Gap, for example, said it would resume operations this month at up to 800 of its stores — which include Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta — but those outlets will look and feel different to accommodate social distancing. Bathrooms and fitting rooms will be closed, and returned items will be quarantined for 24 hours before they are placed back on shelves.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland poll shows that most Americans remain uneasy about eating at restaurants, shopping at stores and taking other steps to return to normalcy. But protesters in several states, cheered on by Trump, have taken aim at restrictions they view as unconstitutional.\\n\\nIncreasingly, courts are being asked to settle such disputes. On Wednesday, Republicans in Michigan’s legislature sued Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over her decision extending the state of emergency there without their approval. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request Wednesday to lift the Pennsylvania governor’s shutdown order.\\n\\nMany state leaders and public health officials have sought to stress this week that restoring the economy will cost lives. But Trump and those in favor of ending the shutdowns counter that the restrictions’ effects are also pernicious.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn some places, more people are dying at home, possibly because they are skipping needed medical care out of fear of the coronavirus. Mental health and substance abuse issues are on the rise.\\n\\nThe economic damage, too, is hard to overstate. According to data released Wednesday by ADP Research Institute, U.S. companies shed 20.2 million jobs from their payrolls in April. That is the worst number in the report’s history and double the last record set in February 2009, during the Great Recession, Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the institute, said in a news release.\\n\\nUber said Wednesday it will lay off 3,700 employees, or about 14 percent of its workforce, as the company faces an uncertain future in the face of the pandemic. Its announcement follows similar cuts by tech companies Lyft and Airbnb, fellows in the on-demand economy that has taken a particular plunge as people stay home and avoid contact with others.\\n\\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have already approved a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package and are expected to consider more legislation in the coming weeks. A Senate committee is scheduled to hear testimony next week from Fauci, while a House subcommittee hears from Rick Bright, a former top vaccine official removed from his post last month.\\n\\nBright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, alleged in a whistleblower complaint on Tuesday that he was reassigned to a less prestigious role because he tried to “prioritize science and safety over political expediency” and raised health concerns over a drug repeatedly pushed by Trump as a possible coronavirus cure.\\n\\nDebra Katz, an attorney for Bright, confirmed Wednesday that Bright will appear on Capitol Hill next Thursday at the invitation of Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), who chairs the health subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\\n\\nThe pandemic’s economic destruction is hardly limited to the United States. The European Union has warned of a massive hit to the continent’s economy from coronavirus lockdowns, saying the contraction this year could be the worst in its post-World War II history.\\n\\nE.U. policymakers predicted that even if the reopening process goes relatively smoothly, the bloc’s economy will shrink by 7.4 percent in 2020. In 2009, the worst year of the global financial crisis, Europe’s economy declined by 4.4 percent.\\n\\nSome European countries are hinting they may look to resume tourism in coming months, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel confirmed Wednesday that the Bundesliga, the country’s highly regarded soccer league, will be allowed to restart.\\n\\nBut Europe is nowhere close to opening as an international destination. One E.U. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations, said its ban on nonessential travel from countries outside the bloc is likely to be extended for at least another month past its current expiration of May 15.',\n",
       " 'McEnany’s response was to point to the media’s own alleged sins in downplaying the threat — a retort that led to plenty of cheers among Trumps supporters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnfortunately, she left out plenty of vital context and — crucially — dates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcEnany rightly pointed out that, in her comments, she had been asked about Trump’s travel restrictions. At the time, the novel coronavirus had technically already arrived on American shores, and she seemed to be saying that the restrictions had mitigated the impact (which is debatable) — not that the coronavirus would never actually “come here.” (Though that is far from the only time she has downplayed the threat of the virus and defended Trump.)\\n\\nAfter making that point, though, McEnany pointed to a series of media reports that she suggested had downplayed the threat in a similar manner, if not worse.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I guess I would turn the question back on the media and ask similar questions: Does Vox want to take back that they proclaimed that the coronavirus would not be a deadly pandemic?”\\n\\nExcept Vox already did. Though a Jan. 31 tweet stated that it would not be a deadly pandemic, the website deleted the tweet on March 24 because it acknowledged it was wrong.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Does The Washington Post want to take back that they told Americans to get a grip, the flu is bigger than the coronavirus?”\\n\\nExcept this story was from the next day, Feb. 1, and the flu was indeed a much bigger problem in the United States at that point. McEnany also omitted two very important words from the end of the headline: “for now.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Does The Washington Post likewise want to take back that our brains are causing us to exaggerate the threat of the coronavirus?”\\n\\nThis perspective piece from a retired Harvard University instructor was from the same time — Jan. 31 — and it was about how our brains do indeed make certain things seem scarier than they are. It did not say the coronavirus was not a threat, though. “The two coronavirus contagions are upon us, both the disease and our fear,” wrote David Ropeik. “The disease is new. The fear, however, is not. Both need to be understood, because both are dangerous.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcEnany continued: “Does the New York Times want to take back that fear of the virus may be spreading faster than the virus itself?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcEnany again left off a crucial part of the headline from Feb. 18, which is, in fact, “In Europe, Fear Spreads Faster Than the Coronavirus Itself.” The story was about how people and places associated with the virus faced a stigma, despite there being only about 40 cases on the continent at the time.\\n\\n“Does NPR want to take back that the flu was a much bigger threat than the coronavirus?” McEnany continued.\\n\\nThis Jan. 29 piece, again, reflected that, at the time, the seasonal flu was a more imminent threat. But it didn’t say a “much” bigger threat. It also qualified that by saying “that could change.”\\n\\nTo conclude, McEnany again turned to The Washington Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“And finally, once again, The Washington Post,” she said. “Would they like to take back that the government should not respond aggressively to the coronavirus?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis refers to another perspective piece, rather than a story by Post journalists. And once again, McEnany oversimplifies it. She says the piece said the government should not respond aggressively to the virus; in fact, it warned that being too aggressive might not work and could lead to the kind of stigma we saw mentioned in the New York Times piece.\\n\\n“Respiratory diseases are not easily contained by travel bans or quarantines,” said a pair of professors. “Rather than contain an epidemic, harsh, coercive policies often scapegoat already-marginalized populations and intensify panic rather than quell it.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s true that some academics who wrote such pieces questioned the wisdom of restrictive travel bans and other measures. Today, though, it seems fair to ask whether the travel restrictions actually had the impact the administration says they did, given the size of the outbreak. But again — and this is a key point — this wasn’t the editorial judgment of The Post itself.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMostly, though, it’s important to emphasize the date of that piece: Feb. 3. Every piece McEnany cited Wednesday came before her own comments, and all but one of them at least three weeks prior. Is it true the flu appeared a bigger threat at one point? It did, as Trump argued over and over again. Is it true that you can point to some dodgy prognostications in certain media outlets? Yep. Even leading U.S. health-care experts at the time were saying there was very little risk involved with the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe difference is in urging caution against too much fear when we had almost no cases and its full transmissibility was still uncertain, and offering bold predictions nearly a month later, when Trump’s own health officials were saying this was a big deal. The same day McEnany offered her comments, after all, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official had said the spread of the virus was “inevitable” and that it would cause significant disruption.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I’ll leave you with those questions,” McEnany said before departing the briefing. “Maybe you’ll have some answers in a few days.”\\n\\nAD',\n",

       " 'Congress’s twin responsibilities are to preserve and reform FISA, but due to disagreements among the House, Senate and President Trump — furious at the FBI for purportedly plotting against him — Congress has not. Key provisions of the law lapsed in March. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) says reauthorizing FISA is one reason he brought the upper chamber back in session this week. We hope the Senate won’t miss this opportunity.\\n\\nTo be sure, the wiretap-warrant provisions of FISA at issue in the Page case are not up for renewal. Rather, what’s before Congress are a program that allows the government to obtain FISA warrants to collect phone records (but not the content of calls); a roving-wiretap provision that allows officials to follow a target across various cellphone providers; and eavesdropping on “lone wolf” terrorists outside established foreign organizations. The practical impact of all three is open to question; the government itself has acknowledged that the phone-record program’s costs may exceed its benefits, and the lone-wolf program has yet to be activated.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor that very reason, however, it’s important for Congress to show that it can update FISA in light of real-world results; for example, the phone-records program could probably be safely abolished. And since the potential for violations of privacy and civil liberties is not limited to cases like the one involving Mr. Page, it makes sense to legislate new safeguards and transparency in any and all portions of FISA that need it.\\n\\nThere is bipartisan agreement on both these points, which is why the House was able to pass a bill with some reforms earlier this year. The Senate could not act because Mr. McConnell and his leadership team, who, along with Attorney General William P. Barr, had decided to support the House bill, were thwarted by some last-minute Twitter objections from Mr. Trump. Reservations also came from Democratic and Republican reformers who want to see even broader changes to FISA than the House enacted.

Had Mr. Arbery not been black, it would not have taken law enforcement authorities in Georgia more than two months to be shamed into seeking some semblance of justice in his killing. The announcement by a Georgia prosecutor that the case would be presented to a grand jury for consideration of criminal charges against the two men involved in the shooting came Tuesday, the same day that a video of the Feb. 23 shooting surfaced, sparking outrage and reigniting America’s debate about whether black lives matter.\\n\\nThe 36-second video is difficult to watch. Taken from inside a vehicle, it shows the unarmed, 25-year-old Mr. Arbery jogging on a residential road when he comes upon a white truck stopped in the street. One white man is standing in the bed of the pickup and another beside its open driver’s-side door. Both are armed, one with a shotgun. Mr. Arbery runs around the truck and disappears from view before he reemerges. There is muffled shouting and three shots sound as Mr. Arbery tussles with the man with the shotgun before he stumbles and falls on the road. There is blood on his shirt.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe two men, neither of whom has been arrested or charged, are father and son. The father, Gregory McMichael, is a former police officer and retired investigator in the local district attorney’s office who told police he and his son chased Mr. Arbery because he resembled a suspect in a rash of recent break-ins. The video appears to contradict portions of that account, and the handling of the case doesn’t inspire confidence. Police apparently limited their investigation to interviewing Mr. McMichael, while a prosecutor concluded that the men had acted legally under Georgia’s citizen arrest and self-defense statutes. Authorities obtained a video of the incident but refused to share it with Mr. Arbery’s family. They seemed more upset that the video that appeared on the Internet had been posted than with its gut-wrenching contents.\\n\\nIt is clear there is a need for an independent investigation. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) has offered the assistance of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. “All I want to do is get justice for my son,” said Marcus Arbery, the slain man’s father. “This is terrible.

Another was Mustafa Kassem, 54, a U.S. citizen who was caught up in a police sweep in 2013 and died in January, though he was innocent of any political activity or offense. At least five other U.S. citizens — and thousands of other Egyptians — are being held in Tora and other crowded, unsanitary prisons for minor political offenses; for example, seven people were jailed for the video Mr. Habash was linked to.\\n\\nA United Nations inspection team reported last November that prison conditions contributed to the death in June of former president Mohamed Morsi, who was overthrown in a bloody 2013 coup led by Mr. Sissi. As the covid-19 epidemic has spread — Egypt had reported 7,588 cases and 469 deaths as of Wednesday — human rights groups have called on Mr. Sissi to release many of the estimated 114,000 people crammed into the penitentiaries, which could easily become breeding grounds for the virus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn April 25, a national holiday, the regime freed some 4,000 detainees. But none of them were from among the tens of thousands of political offenders it is holding. On the contrary: According to a report released Tuesday by Egyptian rights groups, the Sissi government “has instead embarked on countrywide state security raids throughout the past two months, arresting dozens and adding even greater numbers of prisoners of conscience to its already dangerously overcrowded prisons.”\\n\\nThose targeted, the report said, included political activists, rights defenders, lawyers and journalists. A number were seized for questioning the regime’s handling of the epidemic. Fifteen people, including a doctor and a pharmacist, were arrested after complaining about shortages in medical equipment; five more were detained after they released a video asking for the release of relatives because of the threat of infection by the coronavirus.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, and amid widespread reports about the death of Mr. Habash, Mr. Sissi on Sunday released one of the Americans he had been holding, allowing Reem Mohamed Desouky, an art teacher from Pennsylvania, to return home 301 days after she was arrested in Cairo’s airport. Her alleged offense: maintaining a Facebook page that criticized Mr. Sissi. The Trump administration had pushed for Ms. Desouky’s release, especially after the death of Kassem triggered protests from Congress and new questions about U.S. aid to Egypt. But the release of one American should not spare the Sissi regime from consequences for its unconscionable treatment of political prisoners.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'After weeks of sacrifice, much of the nation has arrived at a very difficult crossroads. We need to maintain a stiff battle against spreading infection while also gradually and carefully attempting to restart the economy. Yet Mr. Trump, who decided not to conduct a broad federal effort to battle the novel coronavirus and instead passed responsibility to the governors, is now urging them to reopen too soon, risking more infections, more death and still more economic loss. “Will some people be affected? Yes,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday. “Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”\\n\\nThe president is ignoring the strategy he embraced just weeks ago. In April, the White House announced a series of “guidelines” for governors to phase in reopening, with criteria such as achieving a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period” and putting robust testing in place. Without having met these criteria, more than a dozen states in the South and Midwest are relaxing social distancing measures. But Mr. Trump cannot be bothered to demand compliance with his own guidelines; he seems to have forgotten all about them in his cheerleading for reopening.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe consequences of this reversal may be tragic. The United States is already struggling with a stubbornly persistent 20,000 new infections a day, and more than 2,000 daily deaths. Many scientists and public health experts believe those numbers will spike thanks to the rushed restart.\\n\\nThere is a desperate need for adequate nationwide diagnostic testing and contact tracing so that offices and factories can cautiously begin to resume work without triggering more sickness. That, too, has been left to the scattered and uneven leadership of states and localities, which are unable to deliver at the scale needed. Their challenge is compounded by serial failures in the federal bureaucracy driven by Mr. Trump’s incompetent appointees. We now learn from the whistleblower complaint filed by a senior Health and Human Services official, Rick Bright, that when he warned a group of senior officials known as the Disaster Leadership Group on Feb. 7 about a shortfall of protective masks, other officials responded “there was no indication of a supply chain shortage or of issues with masks, and therefore there was no need to take immediate action.” Such missteps have been endemic.\\n\\nThe nation’s economic implosion demands action, but the correct response is to reopen in a way that is sustainable and does not cost thousands of additional lives. Mr. Trump not only does not know how to get there, but he also appears unwilling to seriously tackle the problem. We may soon see terrible consequences from his abdication.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) released a “Plan for the People’s House” this week that he believes will let the chamber, whose minority he leads, “fully perform its key functions without . . . sacrificing bedrock norms.” The strategy constitutes progress; it’s certainly a leap ahead of what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has done, which is to send lawmakers as old as 86 back to work en masse. But while the hybrid approach Mr. McCarthy’s plan advocates — having some members sit in committee in person while others participate from afar — is reasonable, it would have been more compelling in the analog era. Today, there’s another choice.\\n\\nMr. McCarthy’s proposal would start with reconvening the committees and subcommittees he calls the “engines of regular order” in the House, rotating them through larger rooms and giving precedence to coronavirus-related measures, among other priorities. Participating virtually would be a privilege reserved for those at elevated risk or otherwise unable to come to Washington. Markups and floor proceedings, not to mention the all-important act of voting itself, are left alone: Bills would be shunted to the end of weeks or even longer “work periods.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeyond this, the plan pushes for logistical and safety-boosting tweaks such as voting in multiple waves (as nearly 400 members did in late April) or installing plexiglass dividers along meeting-room daises. Those are thoughtful changes, and they’ll be essential to phasing Congress back in when phasing-in is in order. But the acute phase of the pandemic is far from over; Washington’s infection numbers tick steadily upward. Congress is like any other workplace: It ought to open only when public health experts deem doing so safe. If it opens before then, an outbreak could shut it down all over again — and kill people.\\n\\nThis might be worth the risk if there weren’t a better way — but there is one. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) convened a virtual roundtable last week on the very appropriate topic of legislative continuity in times of crisis; it went well. The D.C.-based firm Markup has a product that facilitates the amendment of bills from afar. Lawmakers could demo it for a low-stakes measure and show the skeptics that it works. Several states are experimenting with voting remotely, proving it’s possible through methods as complicated as an encrypted vote-logging system and as simple as a mass video conference in which members raise their hands to signify “aye.”\\n\\nThere’s no excuse to act as if it were 1918 when it’s 2020. Congress shouldn’t settle for a diminished role amid this pandemic, and it also shouldn’t settle for remaining stuck in the past.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",

Yet at the heart of the case is a question that preexisted the Trump administration: How reasonable was the Obama administration’s compromise plan, and can some lawful balance be struck between the two sides?\\n\\nA federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, holds that the government may impinge on religious liberty only in furtherance of a compelling interest, and only if a policy is minimally restrictive of religious practice. The Obama administration’s contraception mandate compromise met both conditions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nReady access to contraception promotes healthy pregnancies, lower abortion rates and healthier outcomes for women overall. Before Obamacare, cost was a substantial barrier; contraceptives made up 30 to 44 percent of women’s out-of-pocket health-care spending. When the Trump administration attempted to exempt large numbers of employers, it estimated that between 70,500 and 126,400 women would lose contraception coverage in one year.\\n\\nWhile churches are a special case with a relatively small slice of the workforce, nonprofit charities, universities, hospitals and for-profit companies that might claim a religious objection employ many thousands of people. The government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that those people do not lose access to essential family planning services.\\n\\nThe Obama administration compromise would have required objecting organizations simply to inform the federal government that they indeed object. From there, the government would have worked with the objectors’ health insurers to offer costless contraception directly to their employees. Beyond giving notice, the objectors would have suffered no further involvement and paid nothing for any contraceptive care their employees received.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe mandate’s critics argue that the mere act of giving notice would be intolerable, and that nothing short of offering full exemptions to practically any employer that wants one will do.\\n\\nFederal law demands special care for the concerns of the faithful in striking a balance between religious liberty and governmental interests.

       " 'Vaccines are the world’s greatest hope to stave off the pandemic. President Trump has raised expectations for one “by the end of the year,” as he put it Sunday. “We’ll have a vaccine much sooner rather than later.” Is this reasonable? If exertion alone can make it happen, the global research underway by more than 100 groups is definitely promising. Also, researchers have benefited from early access to the entire genetic blueprint of the virus, leading to cutting-edge concepts for vaccines. But optimism must be tempered by the reality that no vaccine has ever been created so quickly, that the process is extraordinarily complex and risky, and that even if an effective vaccine is discovered by scientists, the road to manufacturing billions of doses and distributing them is fraught with obstacles.\\n\\nTraditionally, a candidate vaccine is put through three phases of clinical trials to see if it is safe in humans and whether it works to fight the pathogen. And traditionally, clinical trials test one or at most two potential treatments. But researchers in oncology have been designing clinical trials that can test multiple candidates simultaneously, with a common control group, known as a “master protocol.” If the concept works for vaccines, it might allow a group of vaccine candidates to be tested together, in an “umbrella trial,” with the successful ones advancing more swiftly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLikewise, vaccine manufacturing is expensive and complex. The product has to be produced to exacting standards, and each vaccine type has its own manufacturing process, so companies are reluctant to invest millions of dollars before they know what the investment is for. One fast-track approach, which has been championed by philanthropist Bill Gates, would be to select several promising vaccine candidates in the development pipeline and construct factories in advance. That could be costly because some won’t be needed, but a factory would be ready sooner — which would be worth “wasting” some money at this dire moment. Yet another idea proposed by Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, is to provide an “advanced market commitment,” in which governments promise in advance to buy large quantities of vaccine, providing an incentive to pharmaceutical companies to invest in the needed equipment. Gavi has proposed an initial $2 billion pledge, enough to purchase vaccine to protect 20 million health-care workers. All these ideas will require government regulatory action, and big money.\\n\\nWhat must not be neglected are standards for trials and manufacturing. Vaccine hesitancy is already a global public health problem. Speed is essential, but so are the precautions needed to guarantee safety and earn public confidence.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD',\n",

The deportees were not tested for the disease before being placed on flights to Haiti by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\\n\\nHaiti has not had a new case of cholera in more than a year, although health experts say it will take longer than that to confirm the disease has been eliminated there.

The body of evidence, however, clearly points to Russia, and now a new piece of evidence reinforces that suspicion. The open-source investigative group Bellingcat, along with its Russian partner the Insider and the McClatchy Washington Bureau, reports that a high-ranking official of the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, oversaw the separatists and deployment of the missile. They have identified him as Col. Gen. Andrey Ivanovich Burlaka, chief of the operational staff of the FSB’s Border Service and one of the most senior officers in the FSB, a successor to the Soviet Union’s KGB. The BBC separately reached a similar conclusion.\\n\\nA Dutch-led Joint Investigative Team, including Australia, Malaysia, Belgium and Ukraine, concluded in 2018 that the missile system belonged to a Russian brigade. Then in 2019, the investigative team named the four suspects, who are charged with murder in a trial just getting underway.

But investigators have also appealed for more information about who else was involved.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe international investigators and Bellingcat have scrutinized intercepted telephone conversations during the period before and after the shoot-down. Over and over again, they heard reference to a shadowy FSB officer, “Vladimir Ivanovich.” According to Bellingcat, the officer at the start of July 2014 “was already in a crucial role supervising militant activities” in the separatist region “and authorizing the flow of weapons across the border.” This continued until the end of July. The officer, the intercepts show, “played a critical role in the chain of command” between the separatists and the Russian government.\\n\\nBellingcat identified “Vladimir Ivanovich” as Gen. Burlaka by scrutinizing leaked text messages and travel records, and by comparing the audio of the intercepted calls involving “Vladimir Ivanovich” with the audio from a Russian television broadcast of Gen. Burlaka’s voice. The findings suggest President Vladimir Putin’s regime was overseeing the separatists at the time the Russian missile was fired at the airliner.\\n\\nMr. Putin, a former director of the FSB, surely knows exactly what happened.

While facing these daunting challenges, governors and mayors are threatened by massive revenue shortfalls. With nonessential businesses closed and unemployment skyrocketing, states are taking huge hits to revenue from sales and income taxes, which make up about 40 percent of state revenue. Although the Cares Act passed in March allotted $150 billion in relief funds to state and local governments, those funds were restricted to pandemic-related expenses. That leaves states still scrambling to plug their revenue shortfalls.\\n\\nAs tax revenue evaporates, state and local governments are furloughing thousands of workers and eyeing midyear budget cuts. Furloughing some public employees — such as those who staff large public venues or operate temporarily closed parks — is sensible and relatively low impact in this period, though painful for those workers. But cuts elsewhere could be devastating.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nState agencies are being overwhelmed by demand as economic hardship sends millions toward benefits such as unemployment insurance and food assistance. Social services across the country support vulnerable clients who depend on regular visits — families who may run out of food and diapers, disabled adults who need in-person assistance to meet basic needs, and many more. And along with all the new efforts that pandemic response requires, state and local governments must still run key services on which Americans rely — emergency response, sanitation and election administration, to name a few. Local leaders are trying desperately to avoid cuts to critical services, but without federal assistance, it may be impossible.\\n\\nAn economic crisis for states will compound the larger plunge in the U.S. economy. State and local governments contribute a major share of economic output, spending $3.7 trillion (or 19 percent of gross domestic product) in 2017.\\n\\nThese are the facts that should be top of mind as Congress reconvenes beginning this week. Of course, major funding should have guardrails — the $500 billion requested by the nation’s governors is no small sum. But, rather than a punitive approach that emphasizes harsh consequences for mistakes, the federal government should implement structures to help states and localities spend the money appropriately, like a federal coordinator who can provide real-time support and guidance to local decision-makers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs state and local governments prepare to protect our health and welfare in this unprecedented crisis, why would we want them to fight for us with one hand tied behind their backs?

A greater amount of digital advertising raises the stakes for treating those ads thoughtfully and transparently, but no rules mandate the robust disclosures essential to an informed public.

That means it’s up to social media sites themselves to catch the so-called stealth ads partisan groups have been posting without revealing their identities, and to beef up their disclosure and disclaimer systems more generally.\\n\\nIt may be up to sites, too, to facilitate communication between candidates and their would-be constituents. Google was right to reverse an ill-considered policy that allowed governmental messaging but prohibited paid political content mentioning the coronavirus — in effect privileging incumbents’ communications over challengers’. Any algorithmic changes platforms may make to boost trusted content could have a similar effect. Former Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler suggests that platforms offer free time to the major candidates for broadcast-to-all messages; minor candidates could probably use the help reaching their constituencies as well.\\n\\nThe worries don’t end there.

Curbing class-action and other lawsuits on behalf of workers and consumers — “tort reform” — has been on the GOP wish list for years, and Mr. McConnell apparently sees an opportunity to advance it, using critical state and local budget shortfalls as leverage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow the revamp of state tort laws Mr. McConnell envisions could be accomplished in the short run, amid a pandemic, is one of many thorny questions his proposal raises but does not answer. Corporations have been spooked by the suit pending on behalf of workers at a Smithfield meatpacking plant in Missouri, which alleges that many employees are at risk of being infected because of the company’s failure to provide adequate protective gear or social distancing. (Smithfield denies the charges.) Perhaps businesses, and Mr. McConnell, should be a bit less indignant about supposed plaintiff lawyer opportunism and a bit more worried by the possibility that the allegations in the lawsuit, or others like it, might be true.\\n\\nGiven the medical and scientific uncertainty still surrounding the coronavirus, even quite conscientious employers — the majority, to be sure — may find it hard to comprehend their legal responsibilities, let alone meet them. Existing state tort law may provide them with some protection already, in that it often requires proof of a causal link between company conduct and worker or consumer injury; that’s not easy to show in the case of infection by an invisible pathogen.\\n\\nStill, there may be a case for additional protection from lawsuits for the duration of the crisis — a “safe harbor” in legal parlance — if and when companies follow best health and safety practices laid down by state and federal authorities. Some proposals from business, however, go well beyond that. Government regulation would potentially be a more consistent remedy than episodic litigation, but business generally resists that, too.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhatever Congress does should not help companies make excuses for potentially deadly failures, but strengthen their incentives to prevent such failures. If that’s all that Mr. McConnell has in mind, then Democrats should negotiate. If it turns out he’s playing politics, they should respond accordingly.\\n\\nRead more',\n",
       " 'Though the implications are enormous, the specific issue is narrow: whether former White House counsel Donald McGahn must appear before the House Judiciary Committee, which issued a legal subpoena mandating his appearance almost one year ago to answer questions that emerged during the Russia investigation. The White House insisted Mr. McGahn was not required to appear, claiming he had absolute immunity from testifying as a former presidential aide. Though the courts have long enforced congressional subpoenas against various entities, the D.C. Circuit’s panel improperly ducked its responsibility to do so in this case, citing concerns about the judiciary wading into a political dispute of the sort typically settled by “flexible settlements” — give and take between the branches.\\n\\nIt is true that, in past years, under more reasonable leadership, such disputes between Congress and the president generally ended in some kind of compromise. Aides to President George W. Bush eventually gave transcribed interviews on the sudden firing of U.S. attorneys, for example. President Barack Obama eventually disclosed documents on the bungled Operation Fast and Furious. Each time, Congress initially obtained favorable federal district court rulings that helped lawmakers force compromise. Subsequent deals prevented higher courts from ever ruling definitively on how immune, if at all, executive branch officials are from congressional demands, so each branch preserved for another day its legal arguments claiming for itself maximum power or discretion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPresident Trump wrecked this tense balance by categorically refusing to comply with duly authorized congressional subpoenas, including the one issued to Mr. McGahn, and leaving no room for the usual negotiation. The D.C. Circuit panel that issued the court’s initial ruling worried about upsetting the equilibrium that had previously existed by siding definitively with the Judiciary Committee, ending the era of inter-branch compromise. But by staying out, the D.C. Circuit would in effect hand total victory to the president — also ending the era of inter-branch compromise, and with far worse consequences.\\n\\nRuling that Congress may not ask the courts to enforce its legal subpoenas would leave lawmakers with practically no options to conduct executive branch investigations. The White House would have little incentive to negotiate in the knowledge that it would face few or no penalties for stonewalling. The result would be far less legitimate oversight of the executive branch and far more comfort for rogue presidents.\\n\\nWe sympathize with the judges’ wish that the two sides find a reasonable settlement. In these circumstances, the only way to encourage that outcome would be to rule for the House in its legitimate effort to perform its constitutional function.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'Relatively few faith-based organizations have willfully ignored measures recommended by state and local authorities to combat the pandemic. After New York City police dispersed a few thousand Hasidic mourners who crowded the streets in Brooklyn at a renowned rabbi’s funeral last week, the synagogue that organized the event acknowledged that its plans to maintain social distancing had failed — and that the police action was justified.\\n\\nStill, some religious leaders have already challenged existing guidelines or suggested they are prepared to do so by going ahead with in-person worship services. That is posing a test for officials and judges to determine where to draw the line between religious liberty and public health.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe trickiness of that line-drawing is reflected in the White House’s gingerly worded draft of strictures drawn up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says religious institutions should “consider” certain guidelines. They include convening outdoor or parking lot worship, or, if services are held indoors, separating congregants by at least six feet, encouraging them to wear face masks and providing adequate ventilation. Musical programs might be provided by soloists rather than choirs, and instead of passing collection baskets, attendants might be better off using a stationary box or electronic payments, according to the CDC draft.\\n\\nThose seem like modest, common-sense safeguards. But conservative faith leaders, some of them with allies in the Trump administration, seem disposed to test them. The Justice Department has already weighed in to defend a Mississippi Baptist church’s right to stage a drive-in service. And Attorney General William P. Barr has signaled that he may authorize more aggressive interventions if state and local authorities take steps that violate constitutional and civil rights. “We do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public,” he wrote. “But the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.”\\n\\nIt is true, as Mr. Barr suggests, that a national public health emergency does not afford governors or mayors carte blanche to disregard the First Amendment. It is equally true that the First Amendment cannot negate their paramount duty to protect the lives of citizens under their jurisdiction. Churches, synagogues, mosques and other faith-based institutions are not self-contained communities. Their congregants may interact with neighbors, friends, lovers, grocery store personnel — and, if they get sick, health-care workers. A community’s right to safety and health in the face of a potentially mortal threat cannot be collateral damage in an absolutist interpretation of constitutional protections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'What works is social distancing to break the chains of transmission of a virus that leaps from person to person. We know it works because the early, explosive growth of new infections has slowed. But new infections and deaths are not yet on a downward slope. Every day, 2,000 lives are being lost. It is too soon to return willy-nilly to crowded places or to drop vigilance about masks, hand-washing and discretionary travel.\\n\\nPresident Trump, who should be guiding a national response to the pandemic, has instead abdicated responsibility, shifting it to governors and local leaders. This will be remembered as a dark hour of the presidency during which the call for an inspiring leader with a coherent strategy went unanswered. Instead, the public was told by Mr. Trump not to expect help: “You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.” Just as irresponsibly, his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, is raising expectations that the pandemic will vanish like spring rains. He announced breezily that, “by June, a lot of the country should be back to normal. And the hope is that by July the country is really rocking again.” Such ungrounded happy talk will lead only to more discouragement and disillusionment later.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe economic distress is genuine, but it requires a calibrated reopening so as not to risk flare-ups that would be only more costly later. Absent a vaccine or therapy, the path to this reopening is clear: a process of testing, contact tracing, isolating the sick and returning to work in ways that will not endanger the healthy. Unfortunately, the tools for managing the next phase are not yet fully in place. Diagnostic testing is still running behind the levels needed, and contact tracing is just getting off the ground.\\n\\nThe complex choreography of reopening now falls to governors and mayors. Already, they are headed in different directions, some holding to the same restrictions as in April, but many others loosening the reins now. They must tell a restive public — as Mr. Trump is loath to do — not to expect a sudden return to normal as we knew it before. Those who are taking the risk of relaxing restrictions now must be prepared to retreat if infection rates begin to spike again. The virus will relentlessly exploit any gaps. If some jurisdictions allow it to regain momentum, it could ignite a second wave of disease for others as well as for them.\\n\\nThe only sustainable way back to normal is for everyone to stick with social distancing, hold realistic expectations, and carefully manage the easing, step by step, tested and traced, until the day when an effective, safe vaccine arrives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'The first implication of this is that there is no alternative to massive federal government support for businesses and workers, paid for by debt. Republicans who have begun to raise deficit concerns about more aid for state and local governments are playing with fire. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.), for example, said Tuesday that emergency spending is still needed but added that “the federal government can’t continue to spend money and add to our national debt and deficits.” In fact, record-low interest rates make it fiscally irresponsible not to borrow heavily. The Congressional Budget Office’s April 24 forecast notes that the federal government’s net interest costs are on course to decline slightly through September 2021.\\n\\nThe second point is that, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, the calamity upon us now is not traceable to speculative excess on Wall Street or in corporate America (even if certain industries, such as the airlines, might have been in a better position if they had not spent money on stock buybacks). Rather, the cause is a pathogen that emerged suddenly through no one’s particular fault.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTherefore, it’s relatively more important that money to rescue jobs and businesses gets spent than to avoid “moral hazard” — econ-speak for encouraging future bad behavior by rewarding past bad behavior. Yes, there should be audits to find fraud; yes, it’s inappropriate that the Los Angeles Lakers accessed a $4.6 million forgivable loan from the fund Congress probably intended to go to lower-profile small businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been right to try to screen out companies that probably have alternatives to government aid. On the other hand, even the Lakers have ordinary employees whose jobs are at risk. The deeper problems with the small-business loan program are that Mr. Mnuchin has set excessively strict requirements for how much of the funds must be spent on payroll and that it is still woefully underfunded. If Congress appropriated sufficient cash, arguments over who deserves to get what would loom much smaller.\\n\\nFinally, no one should get too hung up on whether the government ends up breaking even on its programs for larger businesses, as it did with the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program “bailout” a dozen years ago. Mr. Mnuchin sounded an unduly defensive note on this point this past week when he spoke of a “base case scenario that we recover our money.” It could be a disaster for the economy if the Federal Reserve allows a risk-averse mentality to govern the $600 billion lending program for “Main Street” firms it is rolling out with backing from $75 billion in funds Congress allocated to the Treasury.\\n\\nThere are, in short, good reasons to fret that Congress, the Trump administration and the Fed might go too far in risking public resources to save the economy; there are better reasons to worry they won’t go far enough.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",

       " 'Officials at West Point had ordered all their students to stay at home at the end of spring break in March, due to the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus, and were studying how to handle graduation and other associated events for seniors when Mr. Trump preempted them with the announcement he would speak at ceremonies set for June 13. The Naval Academy had decided it was too dangerous to recall its nearly 1,000 midshipmen to Annapolis and opted instead for a virtual event. The Air Force Academy moved up its graduation, sent underclassmen home and held ceremonies with cadets seated eight feet apart and parents watching at home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe decision to go ahead with ceremonies at West Point, pushed back from the original date of May 23, means the recall of 1,000 cadets who are scattered across the country. They will travel into airports in New York and New Jersey, states that have been hit hard by the pandemic, to a location that is 50 miles north of the pandemic’s epicenter in New York City. They will have to undergo testing and face up to three weeks of quarantine in campus barracks, perhaps one person to a room. Partial audio recording obtained by The Post of a video call made by a West Point instructor to a group of 25 cadets April 21, four days after Mr. Trump announced his plans, has raised concerns because of the instructor’s estimate that as many as 60 percent of the class might have the coronavirus, and the uncertainties that still surround this disease and the reliability of testing. Military officials insist they can safely hold the graduation, making the feeble argument that cadets would have had to return to pick up their belongings and get future orders.\\n\\nWhy, though, increase any chance of spreading the virus? Why take any risk with the health of the future leaders of the country’s military? Is it really worth the costs and inconveniences? The answer, of course, is that Mr. Trump won’t pass up the chance to give a showy election-year speech amid the military pomp he seems to value much more than the men and women who are willing to lay down their lives.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",
       " 'Shocking evidence of that came on Sunday, when Mr. Bukele’s office released photos showing prisoners crammed head-to-back while their cells were searched — at the obvious risk of spreading the coronavirus among them. Following the operation, the prisoners were locked down in crowded cells, and Mr. Bukele bragged that members of rival gangs had been mixed together and their quarters sealed so they “will no longer be able to see outside the cell.” He also announced a roundup of gang members outside prison and said anyone “who resists will be put down with proportional and possibly lethal force by our security forces.”\\n\\nMr. Bukele was evidently incensed by a burst of 77 murders over last weekend, a sharp break with what had been months of relative peace in one of the world’s most violent countries. He blamed the killings on El Salvador’s powerful gangs and said they had been ordered by imprisoned leaders. Yet as human rights groups were quick to point out, his harsh response was inhumane and probably violated both Salvadoran and international law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnfortunately, Mr. Bukele no longer respects legal boundaries. After ordering Salvadorans to remain in their homes last month, he decreed that those found in the streets without a valid cause would be detained in “quarantine centers.” Thousands are being held in the facilities without due process or regard for whether they are carrying the virus. After the constitutional court ruled that the arrests were improper, Mr. Bukele defiantly tweeted that he wouldn’t respect the decision.\\n\\nThe court told the National Assembly to pass a quarantine law that preserved constitutional rights. But as legislators moved to do so on April 23, immediately after overriding a presidential veto of aid for health workers, Mr. Bukele forced them to suspend their session by claiming that health authorities had detected the coronavirus inside the assembly building.\\n\\nThe following day — we suspect not by coincidence — Mr. Bukele managed to score a phone call and a friendly tweet from President Trump, who said the Bukele government has “worked well with us on immigration on the southern border.” The message to Salvadorans was clear: The Trump administration will ignore the president’s authoritarian behavior so long as he cooperates — as he has — with the White House’s draconian steps to prevent Central Americans from crossing the southern border.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe United States invested many years and billions of dollars in fostering democracy in El Salvador during and after its bloody civil war. It would be a tragedy if Mr. Trump allowed Mr. Bukele to undo that achievement on the pretext of fighting gangs and the pandemic. The result would surely be more of the migration that Mr. Trump is so intent on preventing.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD']"

       "'The vast majority of laid-off or furloughed workers — 77 percent — expect to be rehired by their previous employer once the stay-at-home orders in their area are lifted, according to a nationwide Washington Post-Ipsos poll. Nearly 6 in 10 say it is “very likely” they will get their old job back, according to the poll, which was conducted April 27-May 4 among 928 workers who were laid off or furloughed since the outbreak began. But there’s concern that many of these workers are too optimistic about being rehired given how much uncertainty remains about health and business conditions in the year ahead.\\n\\nAnd the scope of the problem keeps mounting. The Labor Department on Thursday reported that 3.2 million Americans filed unemployment claims last week, bringing the seven-week total for people seeking jobless benefits to more than 33 million Americans. The unemployment rate has jumped from around 3.5 percent earlier this year to close to 20 percent now, many economists believe.\\n\\nThe United States is facing its biggest unemployment crisis since the Great Depression, as many firms have been quick to let employees go. Economists say the best chance for any sort of recovery is to get as many workers as possible back into their old jobs. Much of that will depend on how reopening goes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I figure they might call me at the end of this month to start again in June. But I don’t know,” said Mogna, 54, who sells materials to construction sites. “If I worked in a restaurant, I probably wouldn’t be that optimistic. But construction is still going.”\\n\\nGoing back to a prior job is typically much easier — and faster — than searching for an entirely new job. It also gives laid-off workers a greater sense of comfort about their finances. Studies show that workers who believe they are only a few weeks away from a steady job again are less likely to spiral into a depression or stop paying major bills.\\n\\nBut economists warn the optimism could be misplaced. The longer people are out of work, the less likely they are to be called back. In an alarming trend, companies such as General Electric and Nordstrom initially announced they were furloughing employees, a temporary layoff where workers aren’t paid but usually keep their health insurance. But now some of those furloughs are becoming permanent layoffs. MGM Resorts just warned it might make its furloughs permanent as well if businesses does not rebound this summer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA new report from the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago predicts 42 percent of the recent layoffs from the pandemic will result in permanent job losses. There are two big issues: First, many companies are going bankrupt or shutting down permanently, so they won’t need workers. Second, even after parts of the economy reopen, many people will be hesitant to shop, travel and go out to eat as they did before. Businesses operating at half capacity or switching to online or takeout don’t need nearly as many workers.\\n\\n“Even if a miracle cure falls out of the sky in July, it’s going to take demand a while to pick back up,” said Betsey Stevenson, an economics professor at the University of Michigan. “There’s no way travel or retail look the same and brings everybody back.”\\n\\nTypically, fewer than half of laid-off workers expect to return to their previous job, but there’s hope this time could be different, since many business shutdowns are likely to be temporary, said economist Till von Wachter of the University of California at Los Angeles.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Helping workers keep attached to their prior employers could speed up the recovery,” said von Wachter.\\n\\nEconomists have urged companies to furlough workers instead of laying them off, since a furlough allows for some sort of employer-employee relationship to remain even though a worker is no longer going to the job. Mogna has been able to keep his employer-sponsored health insurance. He has had to make his monthly payments, but it’s been a big help to know he has the same insurance during a global pandemic.\\n\\nLayoffs and furloughs skyrocketed in mid-March and have kept climbing as some businesses that initially tried to stay open found it was impossible. Americans still widely oppose reopening most businesses and remain hesitant to go to stores and restaurants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnease is rising among many of these jobless workers as they approach nearly two months out of a job. Roughly 1 in 4 laid-off workers say they will be in “real financial trouble” in less than a month if nothing changes. Among those laid off, 43 percent say the outbreak has been a “serious source of stress” in their life, compared with 29 percent among other Americans, the Post-Ipsos poll finds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChauncey Davis is worried about losing his place in Memphis. The 44-year-old father has struggled to pay his rent since he lost his job as a cook at Checkers in March as business slowed during the pandemic. He has been trying to input his information on the Internal Revenue Service website in the hope of getting a $1,200 relief payment to tide him over until he can find a new job, since he doesn’t think it’s likely he’ll be brought back.\\n\\n“Right now, I’m struggling just to pay for meals,” Davis said. “I’ve applied for unemployment twice but gotten no answer.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCongress has enacted $2.5 trillion in aid for struggling businesses and workers who have been hard hit by the mandates to stay at home to try to stop the spread of covid-19. Most of those laid off — 61 percent — say they have received a $1,200 or more relief check from the federal government to help offset expenses, but 38 percent have not.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s a similar story regarding unemployment insurance. Congress bumped up weekly unemployment checks by $600, meaning many workers are eligible for about $1,000 a week in unemployment compensation. But they have to be able to complete their application and receive the aid, a process that has been extremely slow in some states. In Florida, fewer than 30 percent of the 1.8 million people filing unemployment claims have been paid so far because of problems with the filing system. In other states, such as New York, many jobless workers had to call dozens of times a day for weeks to finalize their application.\\n\\nHalf of the laid-off workers say they have been able to apply for unemployment, but under 3 in 10 have received money so far, the Post-Ipsos poll finds. Of those who tried to apply but were unsuccessful, 4 in 10 report that they could not complete the application because phone lines were so busy that they could not get through or their state’s unemployment website wasn’t working.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe coming weeks are likely to be critical to see how many unemployed workers begin to transition back to work. The new Small Business Administration loans and grants — known as the Paycheck Protection Program — require firms to rehire employees by the end of June.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven if a large share of workers do get called back, millions of Americans are still likely to remain jobless. The nation’s unemployment rate is widely expected to hit 20 percent this spring and drop only to about 10 percent by the end of the year, meaning one in 10 workers would still be out of work at the holidays.\\n\\nScott Clement contributed to this report.\\n\\nPoll methodology: The Washington Post-Ipsos poll was conducted April 27-May 4 through Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. Results among the sample of 928 people who were laid off or furloughed during the coronavirus outbreak have a margin of sampling error of error margin of 3.5 percentage points.'"
